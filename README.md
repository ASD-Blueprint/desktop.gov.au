## The blueprint 

The blueprint is a straightforward and secure way to deploy Microsoft 365 and Azure. Security should make your environment easy and convenient to use, not the opposite. We believe that your modern desktop should be fast, secure, reliable and, overall, a pleasure to use. 

We've taken the great work started by the Digital Transformation Agency, and us, then we've added, updated and expanded on it to provide everyone with a simple way to consume cloud services without the risk.

Have a look around, and if you have a suggestion, feel free to drop us a line.

## Style sheet for content

Please follow the content guidance when writing material for this website.

This style sheet records [Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/) rules that relate to decisions:

* to use specific terminology
* follow or deviate from spellings listed in The Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary (sixth edition).

The style sheet records editorial and content design decisions.

When you update the style sheet you remove the need to repeat the decision-making process. These style decisions consider the program's users and are based on rules to ensure accessibility, readability, usability and findability.

Keeping the style sheet up to date means all team members can use the same style, making any iterations to the content as consistent as possible.

It is important to use the style sheet as you update relevant webpages and equivalent documents available for download from the Protected Utility Program site.

### Terms in body text

* `Artefacts` to be used instead of `set of documents`, as the information is variously available in HTML and downloadable document formats.
* `Documents` to refer to associated documents that are not available in HTML. Italicise the individual names for specific documents in the body text, but not when listed together.
* Refer to `user/users` instead of `audience` in general. The user may or may not be a government agency.
* Acronyms should be placed in brackets after first mention of the full name and the acronym used consistently thereafter.

### Capitalisation

* Generally, minimise capital letters for common nouns and adjectives and use only for proper nouns.
* Each of the blueprint's artefacts and associated security document titles uses sentence casing (example: `Client devices design` and `System security plan`)
* The blueprint does not contain an upper case B. 
* Deployment methods and components use lower case unless they are proper names (example: `cloud native`)
* Proper nouns take initial capitals, that is a capital for each word except a preposition.
* Brand product names such as `Sharepoint Online`, take initial capitals.
* Generic types of documents do not take capital letters, example `security classification documents`.
* Lower case 'g' for `government` (unless `Australian Government`).
* All headings apply sentence casing, that is a capital letter for the first word (example: `Design decisions`, unless using a proper noun (`Essential Eight`)).

### Links

* Place links at the end of sentences.
* Always describe the link on par with the destination. Never use generic link text such as `click here`.
* Embed URL in meaningful link text.


### Numbers

* Use a numeral for all numbers except one and zero.
* The exception to using numerals for 2 upwards is to use a word at the start of a sentence.
* The exception to using words for one and zero is to use numerals in tables.

### Words list

Please follow our words list at [abbreviations and acronyms](blueprint/abbr-acronyms.md).

### Frequently asked questions

#### What is this website built on?

The blueprint uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with some custom CSS to generate a static site and is hosted by oobe. 

#### Can I contribute?

Yes of course, you'll need a GitHub account.

The easiest method is to first view our [list of issues](https://github.com/oobecomau/theblueprint/issues), add to the ticket if a similar one exists or [create a new issue](https://github.com/oobecomau/theblueprint/issues/new) if not. Try to place as much detail as possible to help us identify what the problem is and don't forget to include the page you were on that has the issue.

Alternatively, you can suggest changes by making your amendments directly on Github. At the end of the process, you will submit a pull request which will allow us to provide feedback and incorporate it back into the repository. [Microsoft describes this method](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-365-docs#overview) for updating their documentation which is highly relevant here.
