timeline:
- title: 1. Connect and Align
  body: | 
    This is where you start your blueprint adoption experience. The Connect and Align phase is about setting you up with a clear understanding of the [the blueprint](/blueprint/index.html) and how to align it to your business needs.
    
    A large part of this phase is about being able to [self-identify your agency type](/assets/files/pdf/business-change-guide.pdf#page=8). We can also put you in touch with other agencies who have implemented technology based on the blueprint, which you can read about in our [case study](case-study.html).
    
    In Connect and Align:
    
    * Review the blueprint
    * Self-identify your agency type
    * Define initial needs, identify and enlist key stakeholders. Consider using our [personas](personas.html) to understand potential needs and benefits. 
    * Read the [case study](case-study.html) or connect with another agency who has undergone a prior implementation.
- title: 2. Prepare and Design
  body: | 
    In the Prepare and Design phase, it's time to start planning your transition to the blueprint. To arm yourself with the right information to develop an effective plan, this phase will take you through the relevant assessments you'll need to carry out to understand your starting point in terms of your business (systems and processes); your people (who will be impacted and how); and your technology. For example, you may like to assess your [technology maturity](/assets/files/pdf/dta-technology-maturity-assessment-toolkit.pdf).
    
    In Prepare and Design: 
    
    * Define mission and strategy ([Toolkit](/assets/files/pdf/dta-strategy-analysis-toolkit.pdf), [Template](/assets/files/xls/dta-strategy-analysis.xlsx))
    * Assess your business needs or user stories. Consider your Procurement Plan and what resources you will need for the transition. Based on this, prepare your Statement of Work and Section 23. 
    * Consider the Operations Model, which can enable you to consider the roles and costs involved in supporting your blueprint implementation. 
    * Identify your risks ([Toolkit](/assets/files/pdf/dta-risk-assessment-toolkit.pdf), [Template](/assets/files/pdf/dta-risk-assessment.xlsx)) or change impact ([Toolkit](/assets/files/pdf/dta-change-impact-assessment-toolkit.pdf), [Template](/assets/files/pdf/dta-change-impact-assessment.xlsx))
- title: 3. Deploy and Embed
  body: | 
    This is where the rubber hits the road and we begin the blueprint implementation. The Deploy and Embed phase is designed to support you to adopt a Modern Workplace on the blueprint design, which is available to use in your agency's ICT environment and plan for business change.
   
    Often, a vendor (a technology partner or systems integrator) is required to assist the customer through the technology aspects of this process, while an organisational change management partner could assist you roll out and plan the change. 
   
    Additionally, you may like to use some of the ([communications material](/assets/files//pdf/business-change-guide.pdf#page=14)) we have provided to develop messaging to sell the implementation to your various stakeholder groups.
   
    In Deploy and Embed:
   
    * Set up the relevant technical environment.
    * Seek relevant architectural, change management, and security accreditation for the deployment.
    * Implement blueprint technology.
    * Configure appropriate application security controls in line with the blueprint and Information Security Manual (ISM). 
    * Undergo testing and provide assurance that the deployment has worked.
- title: 4. Adopt and Engage
  body: | 
    Technology is always changing and improving. At this final stage of the engagement, we would appreciate your participation in helping us continually improve the blueprint adoption experience. By actively engaging with the Whole of Government community you will make the experience better for future adaptations and new agency adopters. We have also developed an [operations model](operations-model.html) which outlines and cost estimates the key roles and skills required to adopt the blueprint in agencies.
    
    In Adopt and Engage:
    
    * Prepare and communicate strategic messages
    * Adopt the business change and support staff with training
    * Assess [change readiness](/assets/files/pdf/dta-business-readiness-assessment.xlsx)
    * Understand your [benefits](/assets/files/pdf/dta-benefits-assessment-toolkit.pdf)
    * Training and skills analysis
    * Engage staff and realise benefits iteratively

- title: 5. Assess and Advocate
  body: | 
    Technology is always changing and improving. At this final stage of the engagement, we would appreciate your participation in helping us continually improve the blueprint adoption experience. By actively engaging with the Whole of Government community, sharing your learnings on the Community Portal, and participating in evaluation of the blueprint, you will make the experience better for future adaptations and new agency adopters. 
   
    We have also developed an [operations model](operations-model.html) which outlines and cost estimates the key roles and skills required to adopt the blueprint in agencies. 
    
    In Assess and Advocate:
    
    * Keep ongoing maintenance and improvement based on blueprint updates. We update the blueprint regularly to align with the ISM and new Microsoft product features. 
    * Provide feedback about the blueprint back to the DTA, if possible.
    * Share lessons learnt with other agencies.

The [Protected Utility blueprint](/blueprint/index.html) provides a secure design for government agencies to standardise the way you work as well as communicate and collaborate securely. Adopting the blueprint is as much of a business transformation as it is a security and system process. 

As we appreciate this is a complex process to undertake, we have created this business change guide. This guide will support you to understand how the Protected Utility blueprint can be implemented in your agency. 

The guide contains suggestions, tools, templates, and guidance for successfully adopting the blueprint. It is intended for agencies to adapt as required to their business needs and modernisation journey.
