title: Phase 2 Prepare and Design 
timeline: 
- title: Step 1 – Articulate your mission and strategy 
  body: | 
     Using a Strategy Analysis Tool, your strategy partner vendor can facilitate workshops to enable you to articulate your agency's mission and strategy as part of your blueprint benefit realisation plan. A people, process and technology (POPIT) assessment can also be conducted to support to you to understand the business and ICT environment that your agency operates in.

- title: Step 2 – Assess your agency's business change and technical (environment) maturity  
  body: | 
     Assess the benefits, risks and change maturity associated with adopting a Modern Workplace with the support of your strategy partner. A technology assessment will help you to understand your roadmap, technology maturity and environment including your applications, licensing, hardware, peripherals and technical support. A change maturity assessment will also enable you to determine the scale and scope of the business change as well as identify areas of risk from a change management perspective.

- title: Step 3 – Prepare a business change plan and a change impact assessment 
  body: |
     A change impact assessment and a business change plan are important pieces of the puzzle to prepare your agency for adopting the blueprint. A change impact assessment will help you to leverage an understanding of your people in preparation for the business change and the new ways of working. A business change plan will then outline the concrete steps to be enacted in the short-term around who will be communicated with and how.

- title: Step 4 – Prepare a business change narrative / vision  
  body: | 
     A business change narrative will articulate the overarching and unifying call to action for your business transformation. Your business change narrative will be your north star. It will articulate why the change is happening and it will compel people to engage in the new ways of working faster.

- title: Step 5 – Identify the adoption benefits and risks for your agency 
  body: | 
     Assess the benefits and risks associated with adopting a Modern Workplace, with the support of a strategy partner. Using tools such as a SWOT analysis, your strategy partner can work with you to elect and capture risks.

- title: Step 6 – Develop a benefit realisation plan for your agency 
  body: | 
     A benefit realisation plan will support you to identify the recommended path forward in terms of technology and business change. By developing your agency's benefit realisation plan for the blueprint adoption, you will be able to provide a recommended path forward in terms of technology and business change which contains relevant high-level options, costs, benefits, disbeliefs, assumptions and constraints.

- title: Step 7 - Read key messaging related to where you're at  
  body: | 
     Review [key messaging](/about/engagement/key-messaging.html) that we have provided which can help you sell the change to various stakeholders in your organisation.
