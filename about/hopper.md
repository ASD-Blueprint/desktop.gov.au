I started working in Government as part of a graduate program, and accepted a permanent position once it finished. I have been in the Department ever since and love the perks of being a public servant. However, I am looking to change to a different agency.

## Understanding the interaction

### Thoughts, opinions, feelings

* I love the work I do, but I want a new challenge
* Having to repeat the same information is quite tedious
* Going through the clearance process and remembering my details is so frustrating
* Having to learn a new system is going to be super tedious

### Pain points

* I need to find my tax file number (TFN)
* Not looking forward to doing an onboarding process again
* I will have to find information again if I need to get another type of security clearance
* The Department I used to work for had old and slow computers, and I expect the same poor experience

### Want to achieve / get out of interaction

* Seamless transition between agencies
* Ability to quickly pick up the systems since they are consistent across agencies

### Motivation to use modern workplace?

* Once you learn how to use it, it is the same across any agency, making transition to another role a lot easier

## Modern workplace benefits

* Faster device setup
* Interface is more intuitive
* Sees more consistency across agencies

The time it takes IT to provision a new device is reduced by **75%**.

Using Intune and EMS makes it possible to streamline and automate **1,633** device provisioning events per year (based on a composite organisation of 5000 workers - source: Forrester "[The Total Economic Impact Of The Microsoft 365 E5 Solutions](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE2PBrb)").
