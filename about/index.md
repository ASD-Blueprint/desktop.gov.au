The DTA supports the Protected Utility [blueprint](/blueprint/), a design for a secure, modern desktop based on Microsoft 365. This pattern can be used by government agencies or service providers as required for implementing an operating system.

The blueprint helps to standardise how Government agencies operate their desktops, improve collaboration within and across agencies, and uplifts cyber security across government.

Note that the blueprint has not been updated since June 2022. The DTA recommends taking care when using the blueprint. This website will be updated with further information on updates to the blueprint when available.

## Modern workplace

The nature of work has changed. Employees expect to work securely from anywhere, on any device, and collaboratively. Organisations need to provide that empowerment, but they also need to protect sensitive information. Agencies have a greater need than ever before to use cloud-based solutions to empower teams to be more productive and work together. The blueprint enables the APS to transition to this modern workplace.

The modern workplace enables your workforce to work from anywhere, anytime and brings together best-in-class productivity tools. Productivity no longer relies on the need to be physically present in the office.

To help understand users and their needs, we've developed [6 different personas](personas.html) that represent typical users of the modern workplace.

## History

The blueprint was originally developed by the DTA's Protected Utility Program, which operated from December 2017 to June 2021 and helped agencies transition to cloud-based capability and adopt the blueprint. Post-June 2021, the DTA will still continue to support and develop the blueprint on an ongoing basis.

From June 2021 to June 2022, the DTA continued to support the blueprint with regular updates. As of July 2022, there has been a pause in blueprint updates with further information to come on updates t othe blueprint when available.

Through the Program, the DTA partnered with agencies to assess their cloud readiness and support their transition to the blueprint. This included establishing cloud connectivity, training, security advice and assurance, as well as change management support, so agencies could successfully implement a modern workplace. We also provided a range of tools and a community of practice. Additionally, we delivered training to Australian Government and industry staff in Microsoft 365 and Azure, with over 3,000 registrations for the end user training and over 2,000 registrations for the APS digital professional specialist courses.

With the closure of the Program, the DTA no longer provides ongoing engagement support and training.
