The Protected Utility Program operated from December 2017 to June 2021 and helped agencies transition to cloud-based capability and adopt the blueprint.

We achieved this by partnering with agencies to assess their cloud readiness and support their transition to the blueprint. This included establishing cloud connectivity, training, security advice and assurance, as well as change management support, so agencies could successfully implement a modern workplace.

We also provided agencies with a range of tools and support mechanisms, such as the Protected Utility Program online community, to help them through the process.

The DTA, in conjunction with Microsoft, delivered training to Australian Government and industry staff in Microsoft 365 and Azure, with over 3,000 registrations for the end user training and over 2,000 registrations for the APS digital professional specialist courses.

The Program standardised how Government agencies operated their desktops, improved collaboration within and across agencies, and helped achieve a cyber security uplift across government.

## Modern workplace

The Protected Utility Program was the commencement of transitioning the APS to a modern workplace.

The modern workplace uses cloud-based solutions to empower teams to be more productive and work together.

The nature of work has changed. Employees expect to work securely from anywhere, on any device, and collaboratively. Organisations need to provide that empowerment, but they also need to protect sensitive information.

The modern workplace enables your workforce to work from anywhere, anytime and brings together best-in-class productivity tools. Productivity no longer relies on the need to be physically present in the office.

To help understand users and their needs, we've developed [6 different personas](personas.html) that represent typical users of the modern workplace.
