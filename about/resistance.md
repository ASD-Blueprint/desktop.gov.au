I have been working in the Public Service all my life as it was my dream job due to the benefits that came with the job. I have been in the same government department all my life, have figured out workarounds and processes that make me very efficient in my role – any knowledge will be lost if I leave. I like leaving work at work, and believe technology is the reason the world is in chaos and why there's no "compassion" or "empathy" anymore.

## Understanding the interaction

### Thoughts, opinions, feelings

* I feel like I can't take leave because work depends on me too much
* I am indispensable and irreplaceable – without me things fall apart
* Training someone or learning new systems slows me down – might as well do it myself
* I am afraid any new systems will make my job redundant

### Pain points

* I keep having to go to training for new systems that don’t work and end up having to find a work around
* Every time I take time off I get calls and emails with questions about my job

### Want to achieve / get out of interaction

* Quick and easy to learn and implement
* Simplify processes and not have to come up with a workaround 

### Motivation to use modern workplace?

* My job is safe and I can be more efficient
* Others can pickup the work and I can finally go on holiday

## Modern workplace benefits

* System is easier to learn and navigate
* Shared documents, channels and wiki summaries are accessible through the cloud for easier task delegation

Though user adoption of new tools may remain a challenge, intuitive sharing and storage of “alternative methods” used by staff can help avoid the loss of organisational knowledge when they are not available.
