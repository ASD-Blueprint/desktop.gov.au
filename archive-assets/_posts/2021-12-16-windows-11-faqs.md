## When will Windows 11 be added?

With the release of Windows 11 in October, we've been asked by agencies if we will incorporate Windows 11 into the blueprint.

The [client devices](/blueprint/client-devices.html#operating-system) section details the supported version of Windows in the blueprint. This currently stands at Windows 10 21H2 and above. Note that this does not include Windows 11.

However, we will include support for Windows 11 in the blueprint once ACSC release updated guidance to harden Microsoft Windows. Currently, this covers up to [Windows 10 21H1](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/hardening-microsoft-windows-10-version-21h1-workstations).
