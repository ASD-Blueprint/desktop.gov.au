I recently made the move to work in the Public Service and know I need certain tools that are not always available to everyone due to their specialisation. I'm always looking at the latest technology to be able to be more efficient in my role.

## Understanding the interaction

### Thoughts, opinions, feelings

* A part of me misses working in the private sector, it was so much easier for me to access and test new tools
* I am frustrated by all the bureaucracy and red tape I have to go through to achieve my goals and objectives at work

### Pain points

* Not having access to my preferred tools is slowing me down
* Every time I need approval for a tool I need to do a lot of follow up emails
* The agency I used to work for had old and slow computers, and I expect the same poor experience

### Want to achieve / get out of interaction

* Easier approval process

### Motivation to use modern workplace?

* Modern workplace offers a range of tools that are similar to others preferred in the industry (Trello, Team Gantt, Zoom, Skype)
* Modern workplace should also facilitate process automation

## Modern workplace benefits

* Some tools are replaceable with Microsoft apps
* Microsoft Business Store has a suite of virtual apps with easy access 
* Consistency in systems

Though IT approval for certain tools is unlikely to be shorter or easier do to, certain apps (e.g. Power BI) can be available as part of the suite through the portal.

There is still a need for financial delegation when acquiring a new software licence.
