## Conditional Access - Named locations

Conditional Access rules can be assigned according to several variables including named locations. These are the public internet (IP) addresses that Azure Active Directory sees, this is not the Agency's internal private IP addressing scheme. Named locations are Agency defined and are used to authorise logon from:

* Agency approved countries,
* Agency approved network egress or proxy locations (more used in hybrid implementation types),
* Defining Internet Service Provider (ISP) provider addresses when used with bespoke security use-cases,
* Agency Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) or Jump Server network egress locations for administration policy use cases (e.g. allowed admin roles).

Note, named locations should be avoided for the purposes of suppressing MFA on a corporate LAN setting. Consider the use of `Device state` for this scenario.

`Azure AD Conditional Access > Named locations`

* Name: `Allowed Countries`
  * Location type: `Countries`
  * Countries: `Australia`
* Name: `<Agency> Internal Network`
  * Location type: `IP ranges`
  * Mark as trusted location: `Selected`
  * IP ranges: Agency defined

## Conditional Access - Terms of use

The Terms of Use document is a pdf document provided by the department and is uploaded to Azure Active Directory. This is then presented to users during the first logon process prior to agreeing to the terms of use. 

Note, terms of user does not replace the logon banner warning text.

`Azure AD Conditional Access > Terms of use`

* Name: `Acceptable Use Policy`
* Display Name: `Acceptable Use Policy`
* Require users to expand the terms of use: `On`
* Require users to consent on every device: `Off`
* Expire contents: `On`
* Expire starting on: `01/07/xxxx`
* Frequency: `Annually`
* Duration before re-acceptance required (days): `N/A`
* Languages
  * English: Agency supplied
  * Other languages as required

## Conditional Access - Policies

The following Conditional Access policies can be found in the Azure Portal at `Azure AD Conditional Access | Policies`. The polices here are a baseline and should be customised to the Agencies requirements for both hybrid and cloud-only implementations types.

Agencies should avoid the use of trusted locations for cloud app access and use device state/require enrolment on conditions where possible.
