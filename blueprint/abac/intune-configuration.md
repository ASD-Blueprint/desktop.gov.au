| Network security: Allow   Local System to use computer identity for NTLM | When services connect to   devices that are running versions of the Windows operating system earlier   than Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008, services that run as Local System   and use SPNEGO (Negotiate) that revert to NTLM will authenticate   anonymously. In Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 and later, if a service   connects to a computer running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista, the   system service uses the computer identity. When a service connects with the   device identity, signing and encryption are supported to provide data   protection. (When a service connects anonymously, a system-generated session   key is created, which provides no protection, but it allows applications to   sign and encrypt data without errors. Anonymous authentication uses a NULL   session, which is a session with a server in which no user authentication is   performed; and therefore, anonymous access is allowed.) | `./Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/LocalPoliciesSecurityOptions/NetworkSecurity_AllowLocalSystemToUseComputerIdentityForNTLM` | Integer: 0     |

This  policy setting allows you to audit events generated by validation tests on  user account logon credentials. Events  in this subcategory occur only on the computer that is authoritative for  those credentials. For domain accounts, the domain controller is  authoritative. For local accounts, the local computer is authoritative. Volume: High on domain controllers. | `./Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Audit/AccountLogon_AuditCredentialValidation` | Integer: 3     |
| Audit Account Lockout                                        | Added in Windows 10, version 1903. Also  available in Windows 10, versions 1809 and 1803 through servicing. This  policy setting allows you to audit events generated by a failed attempt to  log on to an account that is locked out.   If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when  an account cannot log on to a computer because the account is locked out.  Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record  unsuccessful attempts. Logon events  are essential for understanding user activity and to detect potential  attacks.

This  policy allows you to audit the group membership information in the user's  logon token. Events in this subcategory are generated on the computer on  which a logon session is created. For an interactive logon, the security  audit event is generated on the computer that the user logged on to. For a  network logon, such as accessing a shared folder on the network, the security  audit event is generated on the computer hosting the resource. When this setting is configured, one or  more security audit events are generated for each successful logon. You must  also enable the Audit Logon setting under Advanced Audit Policy  Configuration\System Audit Policies\Logon/Logoff. Multiple events are  generated if the group membership information cannot fit in a single security  audit event. Volume: Low on a client  computer.
