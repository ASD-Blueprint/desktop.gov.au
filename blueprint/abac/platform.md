#### Authentication method (pass through agent)

The following ABAC settings outlines the AD Connect authentication method configuration for hybrid implementation types only.

* Authentication Method: `PTA`
* Number of PTA servers: `3`
* Add Proxy settings
  * Add the following text to the end of the file `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\machine.config` to enable proxy settings. This file needs to be opened as "administrator" context.
  
  ```xml
  <system.net>
    <defaultProxy enabled="true" useDefaultCredentials="true">
      <proxy
        usesystemdefault="true"
        proxyaddress="http://<proxyserveraddress>:8080"
        bypassonlocal="true"
      />
    </defaultProxy>
  </system.net>
  ```
* Required Protocols
  * Enable outbound HTTP – 80 (TCP/UDP)
  * Enable outbound HTTPS – 443 (TCP/UDP)
* Register PTA Connector
  * Execute the following power shell command to register PTA connector:
  
  ```
  cd C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Connect Authentication Agent

  ./RegisterConnector.ps1 -modulePath "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Connect Authentication Agent\Modules\" -moduleName "PassthroughAuthPSModule" -Authenticationmode Credentials -Usercredentials $cred -Feature PassthroughAuthentication
  ```

## Client configuration

### Intune configuration

All Windows 10 client configuration is accomplished via Microsoft Intune policies for all implementation types. Hybrid implementation types may use a combination of Group Policy and MECM to configure clients in addition to Intune policies. These Intune configuration policies are detailed in separate documents that are explained in table below. 

The following table describes the additional Intune Configuration Documents required for the blueprint for all implementation types.

| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| All            | Printer addition restrictions | Device Restrictions Intune Policy will be used to prevent addition and delivery of new printers via DNS name of printer: `Endpoint Manager Admin center > Devices > Device Restrictions > Printer > Add New Printers: Block` |
| All            | Shared Printer Connections    | Prevent user install via Intune policy CSP: `Devices_PreventUsersFromInstallingPrinterDriversWhenConnectingToSharedPrinters` |
| Cloud-native   | Driver Delivery               | Intune application deployment (*.intunewin) via script or native printer installation utility will be used for printer driver installation. |
| Hybrid         | Driver Delivery               | Existing MECM solution will be utilised in driver delivery for local printers. <br>Point to Print is enabled through GPO for printer driver installation from network printer queues. |
| All            | External Printer Connectivity | External Printer Connectivity will be via an Always On VPN.  |
| All            | Hybrid Cloud Print            | Not Configured.                                              |

### End user internet access

The following table outlines the client internet access configuration scenarios per implementation type.

| Implementation | Item                              | Configuration                                                |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| All            | Internet Access Mechanism         | As per agency pattern for Internet access.                   |
| All            | Web Proxy  Configuration          | Proxy can be configured in Intune via the NetworkProxyCSP: `*./Vendor/MSFT/NetworkProxy` or depending on the Agency internet access pattern. |
| Cloud-native   | DNS Provider                      | Existing on-premises Active Directory DNS services will be utilised. |
| Hybrid         | DNS Provider                      | As per agency pattern for DNS services.                      |
| All            | Office 365 Endpoint connectivity  | As per agency pattern for internet browser connectivity. Optimisation of traffic is required and recommended, see [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide) for which categories are recommended for optimisation, and those that are compatible with ExpressRoute (if applicable). |
| Cloud-native   | Office 365 Authentication Traffic | Configured to traverse the web proxy (if part of Agency pattern). Cloud-native implementation types without a proxy that supports SSL inspection will not be able to implement tenancy whitelisting feature. |
| Hybrid         | Office 365 Authentication Traffic | Existing on-premises proxy will be utilised for Hybrid implementation types. |
| Cloud          | Windows Updates                   | Client Devices will retrieve updates direct from Microsoft. Windows Update for Business Update Rings are configured in Intune as per the [Software Updates ABAC](/blueprint/abac/intune-software-updates.html). |
| Hybrid         | Windows Updates                   | Existing MECM/WSUS solution will be utilised for update retrieval.<br>Hybrid Agencies may wish to transition over to Windows Update Rings in Intune (Windows Update for Business) by moving the Windows Update Policy slider to Intune. For more information on this configuration pattern see [Windows Update for Business with management solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-integrate-wufb). |

## Application control

The ABAC settings for the Agency Application Control can be found below. Please note, if a setting is not mentioned below, it should be assumed to have been left at its default setting.

### Windows Defender Application Control

#### MECM managed installer (Hybrid implementation types)

The ABAC settings for MECM managed installer are applicable to hybrid implementation types only.

* Device Collection
  * Name: `WDAC-DeploymentCollection`
  * Description: `Collection used to deploy Managed Installer WDAC policy`
  * Limiting collection: `All Desktop and Server Clients`
  * Membership Rule
    * Type: `Query rule`
    * Name: `Windows 10 Machine Query`
    * Query: `select SMS_R_SYSTEM.ResourceID, SMS_R_SYSTEM.ResourceType, SMS_R_SYSTEM.Name, SMS_R_SYSTEM.SMSUniqueIdentifier, SMS_R_SYSTEM.ResourceDomainORWorkgroup, SMS_R_SYSTEM.Client from SMS_R_System where SMS_R_System.OperatingSystemNameandVersion like "%Workstation%" and SMS_R_System.OperatingSystemNameandVersion like "%10.0%" `
  * Use incremental updates for this collection: `enabled`
  * Schedule a full update on this collection: `enabled`
* Application Control Policy
  * Name: `Agency-WDAC-ManagedInstaller`
  * Description: -
  * Enforcement mode: `Enforcement enabled - Only allow trusted executables to run`
  * Authorize software that is trusted by the Intelligent Security Graph: `Disabled`
  * Trusted files or folders: `Add as required`
  * Deployment collection: `WDAC-DeploymentCollection`
  * Schedule: `Simple schedule`

#### Intune WDAC Base Policy

For all implementation types, it is recommended to deploy WDAC configuration through Intune configuration profiles:


* ABAC configuration for this item can be found within the [Intune Configuration ABAC](/blueprint/abac/intune-configuration.html#custom---windows-defender-application-control-csp).
* Instructions on generating base policy that is used to generate the binary format policy file can be found within the [Client Devices ABAC](/blueprint/abac/wdac-policy-creation.html#wdac-policy---baseline).

Configuration Profiles using Custom OMA-URI policy:

* **OMA-URI**: `./Vendor/MSFT/ApplicationControl/Policies/*Policy GUID*/Policy`
* **Data type**: `Base64`
* **Certificate file**: upload the binary format policy file. You do not need to upload a Base64 file, as Intune will convert the uploaded .bin file to Base64.

Note, the *Policy GUID* can be found within the policy file's `<policyID>` xml block which can be viewed prior to converting to .bin format using `ConvertFromCIPolicy`. Additional policies as supplementals can be deployed using this method rather than maintaining a larger base policy.
