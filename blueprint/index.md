The Protected Utility Blueprint is a set of documents, including configuration guides, to support agencies implement a modern desktop. It was developed in partnership with Microsoft and tested with independent security assessors. 

The Blueprint design is delivered as three distinct documents:

*	Platform Design – All supporting components for the Windows 10, iOS and Office 365 components of the design including Intune.
*	Client Devices Design – Windows 10 and iOS components only.
*	Office 365 Design – Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Teams.

The Blueprint is accompanied by Configuration Guides and Security Documentation designed to the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) PROTECTED requirements for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems handling and managing Government information. These artefacts provide a standard and proven approach for Microsoft 365, aimed to fast track the adoption of the Microsoft Modern Workplace experience.

The Blueprint contains guidance for best practice deployment incorporating advice from the Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM), Microsoft, the ACSC Essential Eight and the ACSC hardening guidelines for Microsoft Windows 10 and iOS.
