The Protected Utility Blueprint was first released in March 2020. Developed in partnership with Microsoft, it is the design for a secure, modern desktop based on Microsoft 365. The purpose of the Blueprint is to standardise how Government agencies operate their desktop, which, in turn, standarises how Government agencies communicate and collaborate and ensures a secure environment up to the Protected classification.
