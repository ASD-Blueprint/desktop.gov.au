This Security Risk Management Plan (SRMP) has been developed to demonstrate the reduction in risk that can be achieved by implementing the CloudSystem to secure access to Microsoft Office 365 services from Windows 10 endpoints and iOS mobile devices.

Each risk has been assessed in the context of the controls implemented by the CloudSystem directly, those implemented by Microsoft as part of the Office 365 service, as well as those that are expected to be implemented by Australian Government Agencies that will leverage the CloudSystem. The risk matrix, including definitions of likelihood and consequence, is provided at [Risk Matrix](/assets/files/security/risk-matrix.pdf). Agencies leveraging the CloudSystem should review the risk ratings and align them to their internal risk management framework as applicable.

The residual risk to the Agency has been assessed as Medium. This can be further reduced to Medium-Low by implementing the additional treatments detailed in this document. It is an Agency’s responsibility to accept the risks and associated residual risk rating as described within this document.

A summary of the identified risks and the assessed risk ratings are listed in Table 1.

## Introduction

This Security Risk Management Plan (SRMP) has been prepared by the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) to support Agencies planning to leverage the CloudSystem. The document demonstrates the controls implemented by the CloudSystem that reduce the risk of leveraging Office 365 for environments that have been accredited to hold up to and including PROTECTED security classified information.

PROTECTED is used throughout the document to describe the maximum security classification of information able to be managed by the system. Where PROTECTED is used, the security markings described by the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) such as OFFICIAL and OFFICIAL: Sensitive are inferred.

### Purpose

The purpose of this SRMP is to identify the risks and the residual risk to an Agency implementing the CloudSystem Office 365 PROTECTED system.

### Scope

The scope of this SRMP is limited to those threats and risks specific to the use of Office 365 as part of the CloudSystem. 

The Microsoft Office 365 service is addressed in the Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) report (available in the [Service Trust Portal](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/Australia)), therefore, risks specific to the underlying Office 365 service are not reassessed by this SRMP.

Agencies should make themselves aware of any risks identified in the IRAP assessment that have been inherited by the CloudSystem.

### Methodology

The assessment of the threats and risks presented in this SRMP has been performed in accordance with industry best practice in line with AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009. The risk matrix that was used in the assessment of risk ratings is included in [Risk Matrix](/assets/files/security/risk-matrix.pdf).

## Risk assessment

Detailed assessment of the risks to the operation of the system are outlined in the following sections which demonstrate the controls required to manage risks within the solution. All risk ratings have been updated to align with the risk matrix identified in [Risk Matrix](/assets/files/security/risk-matrix.pdf).

### R01 Inadequate privileged account management

#### Risk overview

If a privileged account were to be compromised or system privileges were incorrectly assigned, the environment could be accessed by staff without a legitimate need to know. Once inside, the unauthorised user could use the account to make malicious changes, such as the addition, alteration or deletion of data. Depending on the nature of the account used, the unauthorised user could bring down the environment.

  * WDAC provides application control functionality to block unauthorised executables from running
  * WDEG ‘exploit protection’ feature is enabled
  * Conditional Access enforces MFA for all privileged users
  * Azure AD Identity Protection enabled to alert on detected User and Sign-in risks
  * Credential Guard is enabled and credential theft is blocked through Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard

### R17 Mobile device compromised

#### Risk overview

An Apple iOS device used to access Sensitive and or security classified data is compromised. This maybe as a result of the ACSC's [Security Configuration Guide – Apple iOS 14 Devices](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/security-configuration-guide-apple-ios-14-devices) (October 2021) guidance not being fully implemented due to the usability impacts, or due to the use traditional threat events as described below.

Note, the CloudSystem does not include the use of personal iOS devices or devices using the Android operating system.

#### Assets affected

* iOS devices
* Sensitive and or security classified data

#### Threat sources

* Adversarial – Individual – Insider, Trusted Insider, Privileged Insider
* Adversarial – Individual – Outsider
* Adversarial – Group – Established
* Adversarial – Nation State
* Unintentional – General user

#### Threat events

* Obtain unauthorised access
* Exploit recently discovered vulnerabilities, including local and Over The Air (OTA) attacks
* Theft or loss of device

#### Inherent likelihood

3 – Possible

#### Inherent consequence

3 – Moderate

#### Inherent risk rating

3 – High

#### Ongoing and completed treatments

* Agency treatments
  * Policy governing the use and management of mobile devices used to access classified information
  * Awareness training for users with mobile devices
* CloudSystem treatments
  * Implementation of the ACSC’s Security Configuration Guide for iOS 14 devices via Intune Mobile Device Management (MDM), including:
    1. Supervised mode
    1. Long and complex alphanumeric device passcode
    1. Biometric device unlock disabled
    1. Management of built-in apps (e.g., iOS Camera and Books)
    1. Implementation of Intune App Protection policies
    1. Application control via Apple Business Manager Enrollment and the use of Volume Purchasing Program (VPP) tokens
  * Conditional Access policies require iOS devices to be compliant, using applications with modern authentication and MFA
  * Conditional Access policies only allow access from specified countries
  * Conditional Access policies block sign-ins that are determined to be high risk
  * Intune enforces configuration policies for iOS devices including requirement for unlock code, device encryption (native iOS AES-256 encryption), minimum software version and jailbreak detection
  * All information transmitted to and from mobile devices and Office 365 is encrypted
  * Data transfer logs are retained
