<p id="date-and-time">116 minutes to read - 30 March 2023</p>

The blueprint includes guidance for cloud native and hybrid deployments of Microsoft 365 technologies, configured to meet PROTECTED standards. It is designed to also be used for staged deployments that leverage hybrid configurations as a transition step to cloud native transformation.

Each section of the document provides a description of the relevant technology component, including considerations, decisions and their applicability to cloud native implementations, hybrid configurations, or both.

It is important to consider that even if a product is licenced for use by Microsoft, it may not be included in this blueprint if it is not required for all agencies or a product that cannot operate at PROTECTED. Additionally, an organisation may have requirements that will need to be considered outside of this blueprint.

This document covers the following topics.

Section | Description
--- | ---
Identity and Access Management | The Identity and Access Management section includes the authentication, authorisation methods and Conditional Access policies used within the blueprint for Cloud and Hybrid solutions.
Security | The Security section details several cloud-based security components available within the Microsoft 365 suite to detect and monitor suspicious behaviour for Cloud and Hybrid solutions.
Client Configuration | The Client Configuration section details the Microsoft Endpoint Manager - Intune (Intune) management methods and design decisions for the client configuration.
Backup and Operational Management | The Backup and Operation Management section details the backup design decisions including RPO (recovery point objective), RTO (recovery time objective) and Data Availability. 
System Administration | The System Administration section details how the solution will be managed, the administrative consoles that will be used to administrator the various components, and how Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented to control access.

For each component within the document there is a brief description of the contents of the section, a commentary on the things that have been considered in determining the decisions and the design decisions themselves.

## Assumptions

- Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) natively supports the Open Authentication (OATH) standard for selected hardware tokens. To use Azure MFA with OATH support, and to achieve an Essential Eight maturity level of 3, use tokens that are "verifier impersonation resistant" and uses either: something users have and something users know, or something users have that is unlocked by something users know or are. This blueprint and associated security documentation assume the use of soft tokens (with Microsoft Authenticator) and a level 2 maturity for MFA. 
- Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Azure solutions hold audit data for a period based on the service and the license level of the organisation. The time for most services is 10 years with Microsoft Purview Audit (Premium). For organisations with a requirement to hold audit data past this period, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration should be considered. Service audit data within the Microsoft 365 and Azure clouds is often housed in discrete systems and the opportunities to bring the data under a single pane is limited. Azure Monitor or Microsoft Sentinel are two Microsoft offerings which could be leveraged for this purpose however a holistic solution should be considered to ensure any legislative requirements are met.
- The blueprint has been designed to cater for government organisations allowing end user devices internet access from anywhere (head office, regional office or home) direct connected and via proxy servers, VPN servers or Security Internet Gateways (SIGs). Where connected through a proxy server, rules will be configured to allow direct connection for some Microsoft 365 services. Mobile users will access Microsoft 365 services directly. These users will be subject to Conditional Access policies to reduce unauthorised access risk.
- The Intune Console is the preferred method to manage all settings regardless of Cloud native or Hybrid. Although a combination of the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM) Console and Group Policy Objects (GPOs) would be able to achieve the same settings in a hybrid environment, this blueprint does not include MECM and GPOs example configurations due to the level of dissimilarities and per organisation customisation in existing MECM and GPOs configurations across Commonwealth entities.

## Identity and access management

A directory service is responsible for the storage of identity information. Directories expose the identity information using network protocols such as the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). To ensure a seamless user experience and minimize potential identity conflicts, each identity should have a single point of truth / source. Changes should be replicated to but not managed by other directories.

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the framework upon which digital identities and access to resources are managed. Within a hybrid solution this framework needs to encompass both the on-premises and cloud components.

### Azure Active Directory

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based directory service which stores identity information and offers Information and Access Management (IAM) for Microsoft cloud products, custom developed applications, and third-party applications. The identities within this directory service can be either cloud based or synchronised from an on-premises AD domain via the Azure AD Connect client.

Azure AD allows users to sign in and access resources like Microsoft Office 365, the Azure management portal, and other SaaS (Software as a Service) applications. Azure AD also provides control over the following directory activities:

- Registration of applications – The registration of application controls whether users can grant permissions to applications and register them within Azure AD.
- Restriction of the Azure AD administrative portal – The restriction of the Azure AD portal controls who can viewing of the contents of the Azure AD. The contents include user identity data.
- LinkedIn account connection – LinkedIn account connection allows users to link their work account to LinkedIn.
- External user invitations – External user invitation controls who can be invited by users to collaborate within the tenant.
- Azure AD preview features – Azure AD preview features control how new self-service features are made available to users.

Azure IAM is configured using:

- Enterprise Applications - The registration of Microsoft and Third-party enterprise applications. The registration requires information regarding the name, publisher, permissions, authentication configuration and Redirect URIs (Uniform Resource Identifier) to be provided.
- App Registrations – The registration of custom-built enterprise applications. The registration requires information regarding the name, Application Identifier (APP ID), permissions, authentication configuration and Redirect URIs (Uniform Resource Identifier) to be provided.

Where an organisation has already determined that a HYBRID solution is required, [additional considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/plan-hybrid-identity-design-considerations-overview) will apply and these should also be reviewed.

Azure AD Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Additional Azure AD Design Decisions for cloud native implementations.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Identity Source | Azure AD | As this is a cloud only implementation Azure AD will be the source of identity.
Password Reset | Configured | For self-service password reset, users will need to provide an alternate email address, mobile app and phone number during registration. To reset their password, they will need to provide two methods of verification.
Identity Format | Configured | Usernames will conform to firstname.lastname{sequence number}<br>Note: The sequence number is only required if duplicate names would be created.
Display Name | Firstname Lastname | Agencies should avoid using the "Lastname, Firstname" format within the directory as this can cause display issues within Microsoft 365 applications. 

Additional Azure AD Design Decisions for hybrid implementations.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Identity Source | Windows Server Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) | As this is a hybrid implementation, Active Directory will be the source of identity. 
Synchronize to Active Directory | Configured | Cloud identities or Synchronised or Federated in accordance with organisation specific requirements.
Azure AD Connect | Configured | See Azure AD Connect section for details.
Identity Format | Inherited | Usernames will be synchronised from the on-premises Active Directory and will inherit naming convention.
Display Name | Inherited | Agencies should avoid using the "Lastname, Firstname" display name format within the directory as this can cause display issues within Microsoft 365 applications. 

### Microsoft 365 groups

Microsoft 365 Groups are an extension on the traditional mail Distribution Lists, Mail-enabled Security groups and Shared Mailboxes. They are managed within Azure Active Directory and also are used within Office 365 to control access to items such as a Team or Plan.

Microsoft 365 Groups allow members to collaborate with a group email, shared a workspace for conversations, files, calendar events, and a Planner. Unlike Shared Mailboxes, Microsoft 365 groups can be accessed via mobile applications. Microsoft 365 groups are also integrated with Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Planner and are created when a Team or Plan is created.

Membership of an Microsoft 365 Group can be dynamically updated using user attributes available in Azure AD. This removes some of the management overhead involved with managing the traditional group structures.

Management of Microsoft 365 Groups can be streamlined through the enforcement of a Naming Policy, Office 365 group expiry, and creation restrictions. An Office 365 Group Naming Policy allows the enforcement of a consistent naming strategy across Microsoft 365 Groups. It consists of two parts:

- Prefix-Suffix Naming Policy – Setting of prefixes or suffixes for groups names. The prefixes/suffixes can be either fixed strings or user attributes; and
- Custom Blocked Words – Blocking of words in the name based on a custom list.

While naming policies for Office 365 groups can assist IT with governance of group resources, this name displays within user applications (e.g the name of the team in Teams) with that name prefix or suffix, so it is important to pick something meaningful to the user group to form the group name.

In order to create an effective Microsoft 365 group naming strategy, consider adopting a naming standard that assists users with identifying what the group's purpose or function is. Dynamic attributes such as the user's (who created the group) department or office locations attribute can be substituted, for example:

- `<Team Name> - Human Resources Dept`
- `Organisation - <Project Name> - Sydney`

In conjunction with the Naming Policy, Microsoft 365 groups can also be given expiration dates. This assists with unused group clean-up activities. The expiration period commences on group creation and can be renewed at the end of the period (The owner or contact for groups with no owners has 30 days to renew the group). When a group expires, it is soft deleted for 30 days. Retention policies will however hold the data for the period of the retention policy. An expiration policy can be applied globally to all groups or to specific groups.

Microsoft 365 Groups, by default can be created by any user. This can be restricted to Administrators and members of a security group. This restriction prevents the needless creation of groups. It is advisable to develop a workflow to control the provisioning process.

Microsoft 365 Group Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Microsoft 365 Group creation restrictions | Configured <br>Only administrators and select users can create/configure Microsoft 365 groups. | This will ensure that groups are approved before being created, ensuring all groups have a purpose.<br>This setting also affects Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Planner and Teams.
Naming Policy | Organisation to determine | Naming can align to organisational team structure and help identify the working group or a project. The organisation should determine what naming policy meets their business requirements. 
Group Expiration  | All groups - annually | Group Expiration is required to simplify the management overhead associated with groups and to limit Azure AD clutter.

### Emergency access admin accounts

Emergency access or 'break-glass' accounts are accounts used to restore access to an environment or tenant. Break-glass accounts are an option of last resort and should only be used when normal administrative accounts cannot be used to restore access. Example of this is where conditional access has malfunctioned and both users and administrative staff are unable to authenticate into the environment, or all privileged administrator accounts are comprised in another capacity.

[Microsoft best practice](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-emergency-access) recommends that two break-glass accounts are configured. These accounts should be stored according to the standard break-glass procedures. Best practice is for these accounts to meet the following minimum requirements:

- They are not to be associated with any individual user.
- They will use a different authorisation mechanism than standard administrative accounts.
- They are cloud only accounts that use the '*.onmicrosoft.com' domain.
- The passwords to these accounts are set to never expire or be cleaned up or removed due to inactivity.
- The accounts are to be given the Global Administrator role assigned permanently.
- At least one of the accounts is to be excluded from Multi Factor Authentication (MFA).
- At least one of the accounts is to be completely excluded from all Conditional Access policies.
- The accounts are stored on paper, in two or three separate parts, in secure, fireproof safes that are in disparate locations.
- Use of these accounts is monitored and only used in genuine emergencies.

Emergency access account Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Emergency Access accounts | Configured | Two emergency access accounts will be configured in alignment to Microsoft and security best practice.

Emergency access account configuration for all agencies and implementation types

Configuration | Value | Description
--- | --- | ---
Username | Any value that is not associated to a specific user. | Accounts are not to be associated with any individual user.
Account type | Accounts are cloud only accounts that use the '*.onmicrosoft.com' domain. | Only *.onmicrosoft.com accounts should be used as per Microsoft best practice.
Password Expiry | Passwords are set to never expire. | Ensures the passwords for these accounts are valid in an emergency.
Roles | Emergency Access accounts will be assigned the Global Administrator role. | The accounts are to be given the Global Administrator role assigned permanently.
MFA | Both Emergency Access accounts will be excluded from MFA. | Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) device may not be available when the emergency access account is required.
Conditional Access | At least one of the accounts is to be completely excluded from all Conditional Access policies. | The emergency access account may need access to fix an issue and it would not be beneficial if a policy were to block access.
Physical access to account details | Account details will be stored on paper in an appropriate location. | It is strongly recommended that the accounts are stored on paper, in two or three separate parts, in secure, fireproof safes that are in disparate locations.
Monitoring of accounts | Account usage will be monitored via Defender for Cloud Apps. | Use of these accounts is monitored and only used in genuine emergencies.

### Azure AD Smart Lockout

Azure AD Smart Lockout protects Azure AD accounts from brute force attacks such as password guessing by recognising legitimate sign-in attempts from authentications from unknown sources. Smart Lockout is always-on for Azure AD but allows customisation of the number of incorrect attempts and the lockout duration.

Azure AD Smart Lockout Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Lockout threshold | 5 | To reduce the effectiveness of attempted password guessing attacks.
Lockout duration in seconds | 30 | To minimise impact to users if accidently locked out.<br>Note, duration automatically increases with subsequent lockouts.

### Azure AD Identity Protection

Azure AD Identity Protection is the function of provisioning access rights to a resource. Azure AD Identity Protection can take the form of an access policy. An access policy defines the business rules on whether authenticated user is granted or denied access to a resource. Azure AD utilises Conditional Access to define the access policies for Office 365 data. Azure AD using Identity Protection utilises analytics to further minimise the risk that access is provisioned to a compromised authenticated user.

Azure AD Identity Protection enables configuration of automated responses to suspicious activities and actions related to user identities. With Azure AD Identity Protection, risk-based policies can be configured that automatically respond to detected issues when a specified risk level has been reached.

These policies, in addition to other conditional access controls provided by Azure AD, can either automatically block, Smart Lockout, or initiate adaptive remediation actions including password resets and MFA enforcement.

Azure AD Identity Protection uses the following mechanisms to detect anomalous activity within the environment:

- Vulnerabilities – Azure AD Identity Protection analyses identity configuration and detects vulnerabilities that can have an impact on user identities. Vulnerabilities can include items such as unmanaged cloud applications.
- Risk Events – Azure AD uses adaptive machine learning algorithms and heuristics to detect suspicious actions that are related to the user's identities. The system creates a record for each detected suspicious action. These records are also known as risk events and include activities such as Sign-ins from anonymous IP addresses, sign-ins from IP addresses previously detected as exhibiting suspicious activity, or unfamiliar locations.

Azure AD Identity Protection provides mechanisms for logging and reporting functionality that simplify investigation activities.

Azure AD Identity Protection Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Azure AD Identity Protection | Enable the sign-in risk policy and user risk policy within the Azure AD tenant. | Provide reporting of detected suspicious sign-in activity based on defined MFA, sign-in risk and user risk policies for increased security.
User risk policy | Enabled | The user risk policy detects the probability that a user account has been compromised by detecting risk events that are a typical of a user's behaviour, alerting when high risk behaviour is detected.
Sign-in risk policy | Enabled | Azure AD analyses each sign-in of a user. The objective of the analysis is to detect suspicious actions that come along with the sign-in. Automated actions will be configured to be taken when high risk behaviour is detected.

### Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication

Authentication is a primary security control to protect both information assets - ranging from logging into a Windows device, to sending an email or collaborating on a document. When deploying Microsoft 365, the identity for each individual staff member is either in the cloud or both in the cloud and on-premises. Employing multiple authentication factors present a significant challenge for attackers gaining access to a system. Traditional authentication methods rely purely on something the user knows, such as a password. Note, a username does not technically count as an authentication factor. A user enters a username to only claim an identity, then must provide an authentication factor to validate this claim (identification vs authentication). Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is recommended by the ACSC for all users to prove a user's identity before being granted access.

Multi-factor authentication is any combination of two or more authentication sources from the following categories. Biometrics are yet to be accepted as part of the industry standard definition of an authentication factor.

- Something a user knows (such as a password or PIN).
- Something a user has (such as a specific hardened device).
- Something a user is (such as biometric trait, for example a fingerprint).

Azure MFA provides additional security by requiring a second form of authentication and delivers strong authentication via a range of easy to use authentication methods.

Azure MFA provides multiple verification methods, such as:

- Call to phone – Call to phone places an automated voice call to a phone number defined by the user.
- Verification code from mobile app – The Microsoft Authenticator app generates a new verification code every 30 seconds. The user enters the verification code into the sign-in interface.
- Notification through mobile app – Sends a push notification to a user's phone or registered device using the Microsoft Authenticator app. The user views the notification and selects "Approve" to complete the verification process.
- Text message to phone – Sends a text message that contains a verification code that is used as the authentication token. The user is prompted to enter the verification code into the sign-in interface. This process is called one-way SMS.
- OAuth hardware token verification code – OATH is an open standard that specifies how one-time password (OTP) codes are generated. Various vendor tokens are supported.

Azure MFA integrates with Azure AD Conditional Access policies, or the Trusted IP ranges feature to determine under what circumstances and user's physical location a challenge for additional authentication is required . Conditional Access policies are the recommended method to determine MFA conditions.

Azure AD Multifactor Authentication Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
MFA | Configured – Mobile App – soft token code | Native Azure MFA will be configured to secure access to applications and desktops from outside of the environment, and any system administration functions. Use of a mobile app for verification instead of SMS message or phone call reduces any possibility of hack by cloning or swapping a sim card.<br> The ACSC recommends implementing soft tokens without push notifications.
Hardware Token Support | Allowed (supported OATH tokens only)  | The default method will be to use soft tokens which will meet maturity level 2 of the Essential Eight, although hardware tokens will be allowed. Hardware token support is required to support some use cases. Some working locations may not allow mobile phones, or users may have a specific physical token, biometrics or smartcard justification. Having tokens that are "verifier impersonation resistant" is a requirement to achieve Essential Eight maturity level 3 for MFA. 
Trusted IP | Not configured | Conditional Access policies will be used in place of the legacy 'Trusted IP' feature. Trusted egress IP addresses (if required) will be defined by Conditional Access. 
MFA for Administration | Configured | Administration through the Azure Portal and other Cloud Apps will require MFA.
MFA for User Apps | Configured | MFA is required.

Note: OATH tokens are to be purchased separately if required.

### Conditional Access

Conditional Access provides access controls that can be applied to user login requests. These access controls provide an extra level of security to help protect corporate data and information.

When a user attempts to access an application or system from any device, one or more conditions must be met before authentication is successful. Conditional Access offers the following types of access controls:

- User and location based – User and location based Conditional Access limits or blocks user access based on their geo-location or IP address.
- Device based - Device based Conditional Access ensures only enrolled and approved devices can access corporate data.
- Application based - Application based Conditional Access policies provide the ability to allow or block an application based on policy configuration.
- Risk based - Risk based Conditional Access protects corporate data from malicious hackers based on a user's Sign-In risk. The sign-in risk is an indicator for the likelihood (high, medium, or low) that a sign-in attempt was not performed by the legitimate owner of a user account. Azure AD calculates the sign-in risk level during the sign-in of a user.
- Session based – Session based Conditional Access policies enables the control of user sessions by redirecting the user through a reverse proxy instead of directly to the app. From then on, user requests and responses go through Defender for Cloud Apps rather than directly to the app.
- Terms of Use - Terms of Use policy presents the user a one-off company legal disclaimer in order to access the system through the use of Conditional Access. Its purpose is to remind users of their security responsibilities before access is granted. Users are prompted to accept the policy on first use, or after the policy has changed. Their acceptance is recorded in Azure AD. As the Terms of Use is presented only once, the organisation's "Logon Banner" text should be presented on the desktop and Azure AD portal branding in addition to the Terms of Use.

Based on the above conditions, the user will either be allowed, prompted for multi-factor authentication, or blocked.

Conditional Access Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Conditional Access Enabled| Device Based | To meet security and business requirements. This allows only approved and organisation issued devices access to the organisation's resources. Agencies should avoid using Trusted IPs where possible and leverage Intune compliance. Compliance status is reported back to Azure AD and is evaluated with Conditional Access. 

Conditional Access Policy Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Configuration | Description
--- | ---
BLOCK - Countries not Allowed | This global policy blocks all connections from countries not in the Allowed countries list.
BLOCK - Guest Access | Deny all guest and external users by default.
BLOCK - High-Risk Sign-Ins | This global policy blocks all high-risk authentications (requires Azure AD Premium P2).
BLOCK - Legacy Authentication | This global policy blocks all connections from insecure legacy protocols like ActiveSync, IMAP, POP3, etc.
BLOCK - Unapproved Devices | Prevents access from device types not included in the blueprint (Android, Windows Phone and macOS)
GRANT - Guest Access | Approved apps that guest users can access (requires MFA).
GRANT - Intune Enrolment | Devices can authenticate to Intune for enrolment.
GRANT - iOS Device Access | Grants access to managed iOS devices that are enrolled and compliant in Intune. An approved Microsoft app is required on iOS. 
GRANT - Terms of Use | This global policy forces Terms of Use on all authentications. Terms of Use is a one-off acceptance, it is used for users to accept their security responsibilities before access is granted. 
GRANT - Windows Device Access | Grants access to managed Windows devices that are Intune enrolled and compliant and/or Hybrid Azure AD Joined (joined to an on-premises AD and Azure AD). Note, Hybrid Azure AD join only applies to Hybrid implementation types. This policy also enforces MFA to access resources.
SESSION - Admin Sign-in Frequency | Enforces a sign-in frequency to ensure administrators sessions do not remain active for longer than 4 hours. 
SESSION - User Sign-in Frequency | Enforces a sign-in frequency to ensure non-privileged users are required to complete an MFA prompt daily.

###  Active Directory

Active Directory is an on-premises directory service which stores identity information in a hierarchical structure. Identities within the service are composed of attributes which describe the object. These attributes include but are not limited to the following:

- First name
- Last name
- Password
- Email Address
- Proxy Address.

Additional features and capabilities are available within Active Directory when the Forest and Domain Functional levels are raised. The Functional level of Active Directory is linked to several items including the operating system of the domain controllers. To access all features and capabilities the highest functional level is required. For hybrid identity a minimum Forest Functional level of 2003 is required. To use additional hybrid identity features such as password writeback, the domain controllers must be on Windows Server 2016 or later.

Active Directory Design Decisions for hybrid implementations.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
User Identity Source | On-premises Active Directory | The on-premises Active Directory will be used as the source for user identity, with identities being synchronised to Azure Active Directory. The directory functional level must meet the minimum requirements for Azure AD Connect synchronisation.

### Domain

When a new Azure AD tenant is created it is assigned a default domain name. This domain is internet routable and aligns to "{tenant name}.onmicrosoft.com". A second internet routable domain name is also provisioned if Exchange Online is activated within the tenant. The second internet routable domain aligns to "{tenant name}.mail.onmicrosoft.com".

On-premises domains can also be registered to the tenant to be used by Azure and Exchange Online. These domains can then be used for receiving email and/or be utilised as the User Principal Name (UPN).

Domain Design Decisions for hybrid implementations

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Registration of on-premises Domains | Configured | Required to utilise the on-premises identities.
Azure AD Primary domain | Configured - {organisation}.com.au | Required to ensure that Azure created resources contain the organisation's Primary Domain.

### Collaboration

Within Azure and Office 365 the ability to collaborate with other tenants exists through the External sharing, B2B (Business-to-Business) and B2C (Business-to-Customer) services. These are key features for any external or inter-organisation collaboration.

Utilising the blueprints, an organisation can configure collaboration with other organisations where:

- A business requirement exists.
- Both organisations choose to collaborate.
- The organisations trust each other.
- Organisations staff possess the appropriate clearance levels.
- Risk assessments have been completed; and,
- Collaboration is based on the lowest classification level of any involved Organisation or organisation.

Collaboration between organisations assessed and operating at the same security level is relatively straightforward, while collaboration between organisations operating on networks that have been assessed at different security levels presents additional considerations and risk. The additional risks and considerations are similar to those that already exist for organisations today, with activities such as personnel clearances, physical security requirements and the secure creation, storage and destruction of physical artefacts. These considerations will need to be assessed on a case by case basis and risks accepted by the Chief Information Security Officers (CISO).

ACSC provides guidance on connecting networks with differing security classifications available at [Fundamentals of Cross Domain solutions](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/fundamentals-cross-domain-solutions). At the time of writing, there are no automated options for external collaboration from a PROTECTED environment and user validation for external collaboration remains a manual process. This is particularly the case should an organisation adopting this service seek to collaborate from a PROTECTED environment to an environment that is operating at a lower classification. The ISM stipulates that all users of a PROTECTED environment must have a valid security clearance. It is recommended that users of the higher classification organisation collaborate into the lower classification organisation, and that unified labelling be configured as per the blueprints with PROTECTED content restricted to external sharing.

For Agencies operating at a PROTECTED level seeking to collaborate, B2C collaboration is not suitable as it allows authentication through publicly accessible domains such as Google and Facebook. Azure AD Business-to-Business (B2B) allows authentication between Azure tenants which provides a higher level of assurance.

B2B allows the most secure sharing of organisation applications, services, and data with external guest users from other organisations, while maintaining maximal control over corporate data. The collaboration options between two or more organisations can use the following platforms:

- Teams
- Planner
- SharePoint Online
- OneDrive for Business.

Azure AD supports several B2B access scenarios to enable users within external organisations to collaborate with a host organisation. Users will be authenticated using an external identity source (e.g., Azure AD tenant credentials) which then generates a linked guest account within the host Azure AD tenant.

When an external user is invited to collaborate, the following items are checked:

- Is collaboration with the external domain allowed by B2B at the Azure AD level?
- Is guest access allowed by the application?
- Is external access with the external domain allowed by the application?

When the above are all true, the external user can be invited generating an invitation email. The user must accept the invitation by clicking on the link contained within the email causing a linked guest account to be created in the hosting Azure AD tenant. When the guest account has been created it is available for use by any of the applications that are configured to allow guest access.

B2B only requires a small amount of user information (name, and email), however it is recommended that CISOs consuming this document creates a process outside of technology that ensures organisation identity requirements are met. The identity requirements should include the properties listed in the table below and the external user's nationality and clearances held.

The following table describes the identity properties that should be a minimum requirement before collaboration is enabled for all agencies and implementation types.

Field | Example | Justification
--- | --- | ---
FirstName | John | Search and identify the user.
LastName | Smith | Search and identify the user.
UserName (UPN) = EmailAddress | john.smith3@{organisation}.com.au | Users organisation and contract address.
UserName | john.smith3 | Identity in Microsoft.
EmailAddress | john.smith3@organisation.com.au<br>Users email contact.
OfficePhone | 61400 0000 | Users phone contact.
MobilePhone | 0411 123 456 | Users phone contact.
JobProfile | Finance | Users job description in identifying appropriate contact.
Organisation | exampleOrg | Users organisation.
Manager | Julie Citizen | Users manager for further consultation.
Photo | ID.JPEG | Viewing and identifying the user.

In addition to the above, Conditional Access policies should be enforced requiring external individuals to use MFA, block legacy authentication, and block from disallowed locations.

The following table describes the minimal conditional access policies that should be applied by the partner organisation for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Conditional Access Policies | **BLOCK - Legacy Authentication**:<br>This global policy blocks all connections from unsecure legacy protocols like ActiveSync, IMAP, PO3, etc.<br>**BLOCK - Countries not Allowed:**<br>This global policy blocks all connections from countries not in the Allowed countries list. | Minimises the risk of the user in the partner organisation using credentials that have been compromised.

### Azure AD Connect

Azure Active Directory Connect (AAD Connect) is a product designed to synchronise directory objects and changes between Active Directory and Azure AD. AAD Connect enables the on-premises directory service to be the source of truth for identities within the environment and ensures that changes are replicated to Azure AD.

AAD Connect can be deployed in several patterns. These patterns follow the guiding principles of:

- Only one AAD Connect instance can be actively synchronising to an Azure AD tenant.
- On-premises AD can only be synchronised to one Azure tenant unless directory synchronisation and Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) are leveraged.

As only one AAD Connect instance can be actively synchronising at a time, high availability is not possible. A warm standby can be configured using a second AAD Connect server in Staging mode.

The following illustrates the user identity synchronisation between the organisation's on-premises AD to Azure AD.

![AD Connect Identity Synchronisation](../img/platform-ad-connect-id-sync.png#center)

Within the AAD Connect client the synchronisation process can be customised in several ways including:

- Group Filtering – Group filtering limits the scope of the synchronisation to the members of a group within the on-premises directory.
- Organisational Unit (OU) Filtering – OU filtering limits the scope of the synchronisation to the objects in one or more OUs within the directory.
- Attribute Filtering – Attribute filtering controls which attributes from an object are synchronised to the cloud.
- Azure AD App Filtering – Azure AD app filtering assists in limiting the number of attributes synchronised to the cloud based on which Office 365 services are in use.

Each of the above customisations provide control over what directory information is synchronised to the cloud from the on-premises directory service. The AAD Connect client can also be leveraged to configure Single Sign-On (SSO) and Exchange Hybrid. AAD Connect must run on a domain joined Windows Server 2016 or later and can synchronise many Active Directory objects to Azure AD and hence there is a range of hardware requirements to consider based on the number of objects in Active Directory that will be synchronised (refer to the [Azure AD Connect Prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-prerequisites)).

When AAD Connect is leveraged, a user would be created within the on-premises directory service (Active Directory) and then synchronised via the AAD Connect client into Azure AD (the cloud-based directory service).

The following illustrates a typical user account provisioning workflow for a hybrid configuration.

![User Provisioning Workflow](../img/platform-user-provisioning-workflow.png#center)

Firewall rules will be implemented for AAD Connect. Further details on firewall configuration can be found in the Network Configuration ABAC.

AAD Connect Design Decisions for hybrid implementations.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
AAD Connect | Configured | Identity synchronisation is a critical requirement and must be implemented based on ACSC guidance. The source of truth for account information will be on-premises Active Directory.
Attribute used for login | User ID | This attribute is commonly used for logins as it will ensure that the same credentials are maintained for on-premises and in-cloud authentication.
Organisational unit filtering | Configured | To target only the required identities for synchronisation. Whole directory synchronisations are not recommended.
Single Sign On | Configured | Single Sign-on.
Staging Server | Configured | Best practice dictates a secondary staging server be in place to be used in disaster recovery scenarios.
Password writeback | Organisation decision | Password writeback enables additional capabilities such as [Leaked Password Detection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#password-hash-synchronization), however, it requires hashed passwords to be synchronised from on-premises AD DS to Azure AD.
Self Service Password Reset | Organisation decision | The Self-Service Password Reset feature requires activation of password writeback in the AAD Connect configuration.
Azure AD App and attribute filtering | Configured | All Azure AD App and attribute filtering will be synchronised as recommended by Microsoft .
Exchange Hybrid | Configured | Exchange will be used in a hybrid configuration with Exchange Online, therefore this setting is required to be set as Configured.
Exchange Mail Public Folders | Not Configured | The organisation does not leverage Public folders currently, therefore this setting is not required.
Directory extension attribute synchronisation | Not Configured | Not required for this solution.

AAD Connect configuration applicable to agencies leveraging a hybrid implementation.

Configuration | Value | Description
--- | --- | ---
Installation Mode | Custom | The type of installation – Default or Custom. The Default install does not allow customisation of the filtering.
SQL Mode | Local DB | The location of the AAD Connect database. Local DB is the default configuration and the simplest to manage. 
Directory to Connect to | {organisation}.com.au | Azure AD Tenant of the organisation.
On-premises attribute to use for Azure AD (used for logging in to Azure AD) | User ID  | This attribute is commonly used for logins as it will ensure that the same credentials are maintained for on-premises and in-cloud authentication.
Alternate ID | Not required | This is required in scenarios where primary ID may be duplicated between users in the organisation.
OU Filtering | Enabled <br>{TBA by the organisation} | OU filtering will be used to ensure that specific OUs containing entities such as service accounts are not synchronised with Azure AD. OU filtering will be finalised during deployment and documented in As-Built-As-Configured documentation.
Uniquely Identifying Users | Users are represented only once across all directories.<br>Let Azure manage the source anchor (ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid) | Default configuration. As users are not duplicated within the environment, this setting meets the solution requirements. The ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid is used when Azure manages the source anchor.
Azure AD Attributes | Default – All attributes | Default configuration. All attributes to be synchronised.
Synchronisation Interval | 30 minutes | Default synchronisation interval.<br>Note: Password resets and new accounts are synchronised immediately.

### Authentication method

Authentication is the process of verifying one's identity. Active Directory allows for the authentication of directory objects within the corporate network using a number of protocols such as LDAP and Kerberos.

In a hybrid scenario, authentication support is required outside the corporate network. In a hybrid scenario, credential authentication support is required outside the corporate network. This can be achieved using either:

- Cloud authentication – Cloud authentication utilises credentials stored within the cloud to authenticate users. The credentials can belong to cloud only accounts.
- Password hash synchronisation (PHS) – PHS synchronises a hash of the hash of a user's on-premises password which has undergone a salting process before it is sent to Azure AD. If the user's hashed password matches the stored password, the user is then authenticated. This means the authentication method will be handled in the cloud.
- Pass-through authentication (PTA) – This feature allows users to login to Azure services including Office 365 using their on-premises credentials. When authenticating, the user enters their credentials into an Azure authentication service. The service encrypts the credentials and place the request in a queue. The on-premises PTA agents read the queue and perform the decryption and validation against Active Directory. The outcome of the validation is sent via the PTA agent to the Azure authentication service to complete the user's authentication request. Through the process no credentials are stored within Azure AD.
- Federation integration (AD FS) – Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) allows users to login to Office 365 services using the organisations existing federation infrastructure. A federation trust is established between the corporate network and Azure AD with the authentication method being handled on-premises.

The following illustrates the pass-through authentication method and how it communicates across the network.

![Authentication Architecture](../img/platform-authentication-architecture.png#center)

The following table describes the ports and protocols used in a hybrid configuration between on the PTA Agent and Azure AD. The hardware requirements for PTA agents are available in Appendix 1: AAD Connect and PTA agent hardware requirements.

Protocol | Port | Description
--- | --- | ---
HTTP | 80 (TCP/UDP) | Enable outbound HTTP traffic for security validation such as SSL. Also needed for the connector auto-update capability to function properly.

Authentication Method design considerations and decisions apply to the HYBRID solution.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Authentication method | PTA | To ensure passwords are controlled by on-premises Active Directory and are not synchronised and stored in the cloud.
Number of PTA agents | 3 | To ensure high availability 3 PTA agents will service authentication requests. The AAD Connect server and Staging server will form two of the agents.
HTTPS | 443 (TCP/UDP) | Enable outbound HTTPS traffic for operations such as enabling and disabling of the feature, registering connectors, downloading connector updates, and handling all user sign-in requests.

## Security

Information Technology (IT) Security refers to protection of networks, servers, intranets, data systems, data and computer systems. To protect these items, Microsoft Azure contains several security features and products which together:

- Secure the Platform – Microsoft Azure and Office 365, through their features and products to enable security in depth.
- Provide Risk Assessments – Azure AD Identity Protection, Defender for Identity, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint utilise analytics and machine learning to detect and flag unusual/risky behaviour.
- Provide Visibility into User Behaviour – Defender for Cloud Apps provides security operations dashboards which provide visibility into the activities being undertaken within the environment.
- Control Data Exfiltration –Data Loss Prevention policies and Defender for Cloud Apps session policies control the flow and protection of information inside and outside of the environment.

### Microsoft Defender for Cloud App

Microsoft Defender for Cloud App - formerly Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) -  is part of Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility + Security (EM+S) suite of capabilities, providing cloud access security broker (CASB) functionality to reduce the risk of leveraging cloud services, including those offered by Microsoft and third-party providers such as Google, Amazon and Dropbox. To manage the risks presented using cloud services, Microsoft has defined a [cloud app security framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security#the-cloud-app-security-framework) which Defender for Cloud Apps implements:

- Discover and control the use of Shadow IT – Shadow IT includes cloud services that are in use by users but not assessed and approved by security, including Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings. To protect users and their data these services must be identified so that their risk can be determined, and management controls can be implemented. Defender for Cloud Apps enables administrators to assess an extensive library of apps against a wide range of risks.
- Protect your sensitive information anywhere in the cloud – Once data is uploaded to a cloud service it is harder to control and manage compared to traditional on-premises storage. Defender for Cloud Apps enables controls to be applied to data regardless of where it is stored leveraging automated processes and inbuilt policies to both classify and protect information.
- Protect against cyberthreats and anomalies – Due to the public nature of cloud apps they are exposed to potential malicious activity from external actors. Defender for Cloud Apps monitors both user behaviour and app activity to identity anomalies and perform automatic remediation to ensure the confidentiality of data stored in the cloud. This includes identifying indications that a user's account credentials have been compromised.
- Assess the compliance of your cloud apps – Performing security assessments of cloud apps and services is both complex and expensive. Defender for Cloud Apps provides an overview of the industry and regulatory standards that each identified cloud app has been assessed against to simplify the approval process.

#### Product architecture

The architecture of Defender for Cloud Apps includes several integrated components to address each of the cloud app security framework requirements. The components include log collection and analysis capabilities to detect cloud apps, Application Programming Interface (API) connectors to interface with and control cloud app activity, and reserve proxy capability to enforce conditional access app control policies for authentication to cloud apps.

An overview of these components and how they combine in Defender for Cloud Apps is illustrated below in Figure 5. Figure reproduced from [Defender for Cloud Apps overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/defender-cloud-apps/what-is-defender-for-cloud-apps).

![Figure 5 - Defender for Cloud Apps Architecture](../img/platform-product-architecture.png#center)

Further details including configuration of each of these components is presented later in this document.

#### Data location

At the time of writing Defender for Cloud Apps is hosted from Azure data centres in the [United States (US), United Kingdom (UK) and Europe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/defender-cloud-apps/cas-compliance-trust#data-location). An Defender for Cloud Apps tenant account is automatically created in the closest 'Geo'. For Azure tenants located in Australia, Defender for Cloud Apps will use the US Geo.

#### Data retention

The data retention period for information stored within Defender for Cloud Apps varies depending on the specific type of data.  The [four data types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/defender-cloud-apps/cas-compliance-trust#data-retention) and their respective periods are listed below:

- Activity log – 180 days
- Discovery data – 90 days
- Alerts – 180 days
- Governance log – 120 days.

Note, all user activity and security alert information can be exported from Defender for Cloud Apps in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format if longer data retention is required.

#### Administration

Defender for Cloud Apps leverages Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to provide RBAC for administration via the web portal. By default, only the Global Administrator and Security Administrator roles have full access to Defender for Cloud Apps. Other standard Azure AD roles that have at least read-only access to the portal include Compliance Administrator, Compliance Data Administrator, Security Operator, Security Reader, and Global Reader. 

In addition to the standard Azure AD roles, Defender for Cloud Apps also has its own service-specific roles that provide finer grained [RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/defender-cloud-apps/manage-admins). If required, Global and Security Administrators can also grant access to specific users within the Defender for Cloud Apps portal.

#### Cloud Discovery

The Defender for Cloud Apps Cloud Discovery design decisions can be found below. Defender for Cloud Apps Cloud Discovery components are made up of Log Collectors, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Integration, Cloud Discovery Enrichment, User Data Anonymisation, Custom Apps and App Filters & Queries.

The cloud discovery component of Defender for Cloud Apps enables the detection of cloud apps by analysing logs that are uploaded to it.

There are two types of cloud discovery reports that are generated by Defender for Cloud Apps, depending on the specific log source:

- Snapshot reports – generated by manually uploading a log export from a proxy or firewall device, provides on demand analysis at the time the log is uploaded.
- Continuous reports – leverage native first and third-party integrations to provide ongoing data ingest and analysis without the need for user interaction.

Continuous reports can be generated a few ways such as configuring one or more of the following [automated log upload capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/set-up-cloud-discovery):

- Log collector – centralisation of logs from one or more proxy or firewall devices to a Docker-powered collector using Syslog and/or File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration – native integration with Defender for Endpoint logs directly from onboarded endpoint devices running, regardless of whether they connect to cloud services via a managed gateway or directly via the internet.

Defender for Cloud Apps supports a wide range of [popular proxy and firewall vendors and products](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/set-up-cloud-discovery#supported-firewalls-and-proxies-) for both snapshot and continuous reports (via log collectors)  . A custom parser can also be configured for unsupported devices allowing manual attribute mapping.

Once a cloud app has been discovered and its usage reviewed it can be either Sanctioned (approved) or Unsanctioned (prohibited) via the Discovered Apps tab. By default, tagging a cloud app as unsanctioned does not block access directly but allows for the generation of a block script that can be downloaded from Defender for Cloud Apps and imported into a proxy or firewall appliance. If Defender for Cloud Apps is integrated with Defender for Endpoint, app access enforcement can be enabled to block access to apps marked as Unsanctioned.

Cloud Discovery Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Cloud Discovery report type | Continuous reports | To provide continuous visibility while minimising management overhead. 
Log collector | Will be deployed to collect logs from the organisation's existing proxy or firewalls and upload them to Defender for Cloud Apps. | To provide automatic upload of logs. 
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration | Enabled | To provide additional visibility from organisation endpoints that have been onboarded into the Defender for Endpoint.
Enforce app access | Enabled | To block access to apps marked as Unsanctioned.
List of sanctioned and unsanctioned cloud apps | To be developed during build with the organisation's Cyber Intelligence team. | Provides visibility within the organisation as to what cloud applications are in use and by which department within the organisation.

##### Automatic log upload & Log collectors

A log collector receives logs from supported firewall and proxy devices, providing processing and compression before uploading to Defender for Cloud Apps. The compression typically results in outbound traffic from the log collectors being 10% the size of received traffic. The steps to configure automatic log upload for continuous reports is available at [Configure automatic log upload for continuous reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/discovery-docker).

A log collector can receive logs via FTP - including FTP over Transport Layer Security (TLS) - and Syslog.

Log collectors are deployed as a Docker container using a Microsoft-provided Docker image for both Windows and Linux operating systems.

The Docker container is supported on Windows 10 and Windows Server version 1709 and later, Ubuntu versions 14.04, 16.04 and 18.04, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS 7.2 or later. The image can be deployed on VMs either hosted on-premises or within Azure, provided suitable network connectivity from the proxy/firewall devices is available.

Log Collector Design Decisions for agencies that use a centralised internet gateway.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Number of log collectors | One | An increase in the number of log collectors may be necessary if there is excessive traffic.
Log collector deployment mode | Docker container | Maximise support life as virtual appliance has been deprecated.
Log collector location | Within the organisation Gateway zone | Minimise number of firewall ports to be opened between the existing proxies and the log collector.
Log collector operating system | Organisation's discretion of supported operating system for Defender for Cloud Apps Log Collector. | Defender for Cloud Apps supports Windows and Linux (Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS) operating systems for the Log Collector.

##### App tags 

Defender for Cloud Apps supports the creation and assignment of custom app tags from within the portal. Security analysts can create and apply custom tags to allow them to filter and query results specific to an area of interest. For example, a custom tag may be created for a business unit and that tag applied to only the applications that are approved for their use (i.e. Procurement). An analyst can then quickly filter based on this tag to review the use of these applications.

App tags Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Custom tags | Configured on demand | Custom tags will be added to Cloud Discovery as they are identified by the organisation.

##### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration

Defender for Endpoint integration enables cloud app and service traffic to be sent from supported Windows 10 devices (1709 or later) to Defender for Cloud Apps to provide additional data for continuous reporting.

This capability is enabled from within the Endpoints > Advanced Features settings within the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, as shown below in Figure 6. Figure reproduced from [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration with Microsoft Cloud App Security
](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/cloud-app-security/mde-integration).

![Figure 6 - Defender for Endpoint and Defender for Cloud Apps Integration](../img/platform-defender-mcas.png#center)

Important Note: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint should be configured prior to enabling this feature. 

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal configuration | Microsoft Cloud App Security enabled | To enable Defender for Endpoint integration with Defender for Cloud Apps.

##### User enrichment

To further enrich cloud discovery data Defender for Cloud Apps can integrate with Azure AD to replace users identified with Azure AD usernames.

This simplifies identification and investigation of user activity, as well as allowing correlation with API collected activities.

Cloud Discovery Enrichment Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
User enrichment | Enabled | To identify users by Azure AD username.

##### Anonymization

To protect the privacy of users Defender for Cloud Apps supports anonymisation of usernames when logs are uploaded. This is done by encrypting the usernames included in logs using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 128-bit key which is unique to each tenant.

Security analysts can resolve encrypted usernames on demand to assist in investigations, and each username conversion is recorded in the Governance log. In addition to usernames, Defender for Cloud Apps can also anonymise Windows 10 machine names.

User Data Anonymization Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Username anonymisation | Not enabled | Reduced investigation effort by not requiring security analysts to decrypt usernames on demand. If the organisation identifies a requirement this can be enabled.
Machine name anonymisation | Not enabled | Reduced investigation effort by not requiring security analysts to decrypt machine names on demand. If the organisation identifies a requirement this can be enabled.

#### Custom apps

In addition to the extensive library of cloud apps that are natively available in Cloud Discovery, custom cloud apps – for example internally developed Line of Business (LOB) applications – can be added to provide visibility in their use.

This allows Cloud Discovery to identify these custom cloud apps from uploaded firewall and proxy logs and enables security analysts to filter on them specifically.

Custom Apps Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Custom Apps | Configured on demand | Custom apps will be added to Cloud Discovery as they are identified by the organisation.

#### App connectors

App connectors enable Defender for Cloud Apps to see and reach inside connected cloud apps, providing both visibility into, and control of, the information stored by them. App connectors use APIs provided by the cloud app vendors, with capabilities varying between third-party cloud app vendors.

To support multiple instances of a single cloud app, for example different teams owning and managing their own subscriptions, Defender for Cloud Apps supports connecting multiple instances of the same cloud app. However, multi-instance support is only provided for API connected apps and is not available for cloud discovered and proxy connected apps. Additionally, multi-instance support is not available for Azure and Office 365.

At the time of writing, the following API app connectors are [available in Defender for Cloud Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/enable-instant-visibility-protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps):

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Azure
- Box
- Dropbox
- GitHub
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Google Workspace
- Office 365
- Okta
- OneLogin
- Service Now
- Salesforce
- Slack
- Smartsheet
- WebEx
- Workday
- ZenDesk (Preview)

To connect to each cloud app via API Defender for Cloud Apps requires an account within that app that has administrative privileges with full access to all objects stored within it. The name of this specific privilege level is specific to each cloud app, e.g. Global Admin for Office 365 and Super Admin for G Suite. It is recommended that a dedicated account is used for integration with Defender for Cloud Apps for each connected app.

App Connectors Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Use of app connectors | Preferred for all supported cloud apps. | Provides the greatest available level of visibility and connect of the connected apps. 
API administrator accounts | Dedicated account for Defender for Cloud Apps for each connected app that requires one. | Microsoft best practice to manage connected apps. 
List of connected apps | Azure<br>Office 365 | All approved cloud apps that are supported will be connected to Defender for Cloud Apps via API. 
Office 365 Connector Configuration | Selected Components:<br>Azure AD Users and Groups<br>Azure AD Management events<br>Azure AD Sign-in events<br>Azure AD Apps<br>Office 365 activities<br>Office 365 files | All components of Office 365 on which Cloud App Security can obtain information. 

Note, the Azure connector does not have any configurable settings.

#### Policies

Defender for Cloud Apps supports a range of policy types to address the various risks associated with leveraging cloud apps, ranging from the detection of new and therefore unsanctioned cloud apps to identifying anomalous user activities that are outside the pattern of normal behaviour.

Up to seven policy types are available in Defender for Cloud Apps depending on the data sources that have been enabled. These include:

- Access policies – providing real-time monitoring and control of user logins to identified cloud apps.
- Activity policies – leveraging integration with each cloud app's API, provides monitoring and control of activities within those applications (specific activities dependent on each vendor's API capabilities).
- Anomaly detection policy – detecting anomalous activities within connected cloud apps based on specific risk factors compared with a pre-determined baseline.
- App discovery policy – detecting new (unsanctioned) cloud apps and provides associated alerts.
- Cloud Discovery anomaly detection policy – reviewing the logs provided to Cloud Discovery specifically (as previously described) to detect anomalous behaviour.
- File policy – enabling scanning of connected cloud apps to detect and apply restrictions to specific sensitive files and content.
- Session policy – providing real-time monitoring and control of user activities within authenticated sessions to identified cloud apps.

Note, Access and Sessions policies are covered in additional detail in the Conditional Access App Control section later in this document.

In addition to the policy types listed above, Defender for Cloud Apps provides pre-configured policy templates that can be used to streamline policy development and enforcement. Custom policies can also be created by specifying a trigger.

Policies Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Use of policies | Enable all in-built policies.<br>Agencies should also consider developing custom policies to match their specific use-cases. | Provides visibility within the organisation of suspicious behaviour and application use. 

#### Threat Protection

The Defender for Cloud Apps Threat Protection design decisions can be found below. Threat Protection components include Microsoft Defender for Identity.

##### Microsoft Defender for Identity integration

Microsoft Defender for Identity provides User Entity Behavioural Analytics (UEBA) by monitoring authentication requests to on-premises Active Directory (AD) Domain Controllers (DCs).

Integrating Defender for Identity with Defender for Cloud Apps extends this capability to hybrid environments and presents all Defender for Identity Suspicious Activity (SA) alerts to the Defender for Cloud Apps dashboard, reducing the need for security analysts to monitor multiple consoles. To connect Defender for Identity to Defender for Cloud Apps the user enabling the setting must be an Azure AD Global Admin. Integration is enabled in the Defender for Cloud Apps console and does not require configuration from the Defender for Identity console.

Defender for Identity integration Design Decisions for hybrid implementations.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Defender for Identity integration | Enabled | To enable integration between security tools deployed within the organisation's environment.

##### Azure AD Identity Protection integration

Azure AD Identity Protection enables configuration of automated responses to suspicious activities and actions related to user identities.

Integrating Azure AD Identity Protection with Defender for Cloud Apps provides a uniformed alerts view within Defender for Cloud Apps, and enables an enhanced investigation experience for identity alerts.

Azure AD Identity Protection integration Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Azure AD Identity Protection integration | Enabled | To enable integration between security tools deployed within the organisation's environment.

##### App Governance

App Governance is an add-on capability for Defender for Cloud Apps that provides a security and policy management capability for OAuth-enabled apps that access Microsoft 365 data via Microsoft's Graph APIs.

At the time of writing App Governance is in [Public Preview](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/announcing-public-preview-of-app-governance/ba-p/2543768).

App Governance Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
App Governance | Not configured | The blueprint does not include an third-party OAuth-enabled apps that access Microsoft 365 data.

#### Information Protection

The Defender for Cloud Apps Information Protection design decisions can be found below. Information Protection components include Admin Quarantine, Microsoft Information Protection, Azure Security and Files.

##### Admin Quarantine

The admin quarantine is used to store files for administrative review that have been matched against an Defender for Cloud Apps file policy. Examples include identifying and removing files from cloud apps that include sensitive content, such as financial and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that should only be stored on-premises and not shared to external collaborators. 

Note, files that are detected as malware and are stored in either SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business are not quarantined by Defender for Cloud Apps.

Before a file policy can be configured to use the admin quarantine a folder location for it must first be identified. Only a single admin quarantine folder location is configured for each Defender for Cloud Apps instance and is used by all file policies that leverage this capability. A user notification can also be configured to provide an explanation to users when they attempt to access a quarantined file.

Admin quarantine Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Admin quarantine folder location | Configured | Folder location is organisation-specific and will be determined via an organisation's internal decision processes.
User notification | Default text – `This file was quarantined because it might conflict with your organisation's security and compliance policies. Contact your IT administrator for more information.` | Notify user that file has been quarantined using default text. Organisation to determine whether default text meets IT security requirements.

##### Microsoft Information Protection

Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) provides document and email classification labelling, and protections based on those labels, across hybrid environments. Defender for Cloud Apps can be configured to scan for MIP classification labels and content inspection warning when new files are detected in connected apps. Additionally, Defender for Cloud Apps can be configured to only scan labels and warning originating from its tenant, therefore ignoring labels from external tenants.

To enable Defender for Cloud Apps to inspect the content of files that have been protected by MIP it must be granted that permission in Azure AD. This is done via a guided activity initiated from the Defender for Cloud Apps portal.

Microsoft Information Protection Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Automatically scan new files for MIP classification labels and content inspection warnings | Enabled | Defender for Cloud Apps is enabled to scan new files for MIP classifications as the blueprint will leverage Information Protection classification.
Only scan files for MIP classification labels and content inspection warnings from this tenant | Enabled | Defender for Cloud Apps is enabled to scan files for MIP classification from the tenant as the blueprint will leverage Information Protection classification.
Inspect protected files | Enabled | Defender for Cloud Apps is enabled to inspect protected files as the blueprint will leverage Information Protection classification.

##### Files

As previously described, file policies can be used to manage documents stored in cloud apps. To enable this capability Defender for Cloud Apps must be allowed to monitor files stored in these apps.

There are no design considerations.

Defender for Cloud Apps Files Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
File monitoring | Enabled | Allow Defender for Cloud Apps to monitor files stored in connected cloud apps.

#### Conditional Access app control protection

The Conditional Access App Control Protection design decisions can be found below. Conditional Access App Control components include Default Behaviour, User Monitoring, Device Identification and App Onboarding/Maintenance.

The Conditional Access App Control capability of Defender for Cloud Apps leverages Azure AD Conditional Access to enforce actions (such as blocking accessing) based on specific conditions (such as device compliance) by using a reverse proxy architecture. Users' cloud app sessions, including authentication, are proxied by Defender for Cloud Apps instead of going directly to the app. Defender for Cloud Apps does this by replacing the app's Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and cookies, therefore not requiring an agent to be installed on the endpoints.

Examples of the Conditional Access App Control policies that can be configured to monitor and control user app access and sessions in real time are listed below:

- Prevent data exfiltration – block copy and cut clipboard actions, printing and downloading of sensitive information and documents.
- Protect on download – allows sensitive documents to be downloaded by leveraging MIP applies a classification label and protection to it.
- Prevent upload of unlabelled files – blocks documents from being uploaded until a user applies an MIP label to them based on the sensitivity of the information they contain.
- Monitor user sessions for compliance – identify risky users based on their behaviour during a session.
- Block access – based on specific risk factors can prevent users and/or devices from accessing specific resources across one or all connected apps.
- Block custom activities – application-specific events can be blocked if they increase the risk of data leakage or exfiltration.

Conditional Access App Control Protection Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Access control policies | Use of policies is organisation-specific and would need further development with internal cyber security team. | Provides a greater security posture for the organisation applications.
Session control policies | Use of policies is organisation-specific and would need further development with internal cyber security team. | Provides a greater security posture for users within the organisation.

##### Default behaviour

In the event of a system outage or downtime Defender for Cloud Apps can be configured with a Default Behaviour.

This is a deployment wide setting which can be configured to either prevent users from accessing an app if normal policy cannot be enforced, or to provide unrestricted access if this occurs.

Default Behaviour Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Default behaviour configuration | Allow access | To prevent interruption to business functions in the event of an outage or downtime.

##### User monitoring

When using Conditional Access App Control to manage access and sessions, Defender for Cloud Apps provides the option to notify users that their activities are being monitored.

If user notifications are enabled administrators can either use a Microsoft-provided default message or provide their own, which will include their organisational logo (if it has been uploaded to Defender for Cloud Apps).

User Monitoring Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
User monitoring notifications | Not enabled | There is no default requirement to notify users. Agencies can enable User Monitoring as appropriate to meet operational requirements without impacting the cyber security posture of the environment.

##### Device identification

Defender for Cloud Apps and Conditional Access App Control can be utilised to identify managed devices within the organisation.

Defender for Cloud Apps and Conditional Access App Control support three methods to identified managed devices:

- Microsoft Intune (specifically devices that are identified as Compliant).
- Hybrid Azure AD joined devices.
- The presence of client certificates that are part of a trusted chain.

A combination of multiple of these methods can be configured if required to identify devices within a diverse environment. Devices that are present in Intune, as well as those that are registered to Azure AD (hybrid joined), are automatically synchronised to Defender for Cloud Apps. To use client certificates to identify devices either a trusted root or intermediate certificate must be uploaded to Defender for Cloud Apps in Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) format.

Device Identification Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Use of client certificates for device identification | Not configured | No requirement to use client certificates has been identified as the organisation will leverage Intune for compliant and Hybrid Azure AD devices.

##### App onboarding/maintenance

Specific users can be identified that can enable currently unsupported cloud apps to be onboarded to Conditional Access App Control for development and testing purposes.

These users can be identified by either email or User Principal Name (UPN) and must be configured within the Defender for Cloud Apps console. Once an app is onboarded by a specified user a feedback bar will be presented as part of the application to enable developers and testers to provide feedback directly back to Microsoft's Cloud App Security team.

App Onboarding/Maintenance Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Included users | To be developed during build with the organisation's Cyber Intelligence team. | Organisation to determine if a requirement for users and non-supported apps exist within the environment.

#### Security extensions

To integrate with other security solutions, for example Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) products, Defender for Cloud Apps supports a range of security extensions. These include:

- API tokens – to provide access to Defender for Cloud Apps Representational State Transfer (REST) API endpoints for read and update operations.
- SIEM agents – to centralise alerts and activities from Defender for Cloud Apps to a SIEM.
- External Data Loss Prevention (DLP) – to connect Defender for Cloud Apps to external DLP solutions.
- Playbooks – to leverage Microsoft Flow playbooks for automation.

Each of these security extension capabilities is described in the following sections.

##### API tokens

By creating API tokens within the Defender for Cloud Apps portal external applications can connect to the REST API endpoints and perform a range of read and update operations.

A common use-case for this is to generate block scripts from a third-party network appliance, or to resolve alerts that have been investigated through a connected SIEM product.

API token Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
API tokens | Not configured | An organisation can determine and identify whether use cases exist for the creation of API tokens in their specific environments however for a base implementation of the blueprint, API tokens are not required.

##### SIEM agents

To enable Defender for Cloud Apps alerts and activities to be integrated into existing security analyst workflows that have been developed in SIEM products Defender for Cloud Apps provides SIEM agents.

The Defender for Cloud Apps SIEM agent runs on a server – either on-premises or as IaaS – and acts as a forwarder between Defender for Cloud Apps and the SIEM. The SIEM agent makes an outgoing request to Defender for Cloud Apps over an encrypted Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) channel using port 443, leveraging the Defender for Cloud Apps RESTful APIs. Once the data has been downloaded it then forwards it to the SIEM as syslog messages on a configurable Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port.  

Note, if both Defender for Identity and Defender for Cloud Apps are configured to send alerts to the same SIEM duplicate alerts will be received with different alert IDs. It is recommended to only send these alerts from one source.

At the time of writing the SIEM agent only supports Micro Focus ArcSight and generic [Common Event Format (CEF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/siem). Supported time formats include Request for Comment (RFC) 5424, 3164 and 3164 with year. The agent can be installed on either Windows or Linux operating systems and requires Java 8.

In addition to the SIEM agent, Defender for Cloud Apps supports native integration with Microsoft Sentinel and the Microsoft Security Graph API. Microsoft Sentinel is Microsoft's cloud native SIEM offering, while the Security Graph API provides additional partner integration solutions, e.g. the Microsoft Graph Security API Add-On for Splunk.

SIEM agents Design Decisions for cloud native implementations.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Microsoft Sentinel integration | Configured | To support integration between Defender for Cloud Apps and Microsoft cloud native SIEM solution.
Microsoft Sentinel license | Yes | To enable Microsoft Sentinel integration a Microsoft Sentinel license is required. 

SIEM agents Design Decisions for hybrid implementations.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Use of SIEM agent | Yes | To support integration between Defender for Cloud Apps and the organisation's existing SIEM solution.
SIEM agent install location | Organisation's discretion of supported operating system for Defender for Cloud Apps SIEM agents. | Defender for Cloud Apps supports Windows and Linux operating systems for the SIEM agents.
Microsoft Security Graph API integration | Not configured | Organisation to determine whether requirement exists based on existing SIEM solution.

##### External Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

In addition to integration with third-party SIEMs, Defender for Cloud Apps also supports integration with third-party DLP providers, enabling existing investments in on-premises solutions to be extended into the cloud.

Integration between external DLP solution and Defender for Cloud Apps is performed via the Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) protocol which is tunnelled over TLS. This allows Defender for Cloud Apps to use the external DLP engine to scan content identified in connected cloud apps for policy violations.

External DLP Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
External DLP | Not configured | Not configured by default however an organisation can determine whether a DLP solution will be leveraged and if there is a requirement to be integrated with Defender for Cloud Apps.

##### Playbooks

Defender for Cloud Apps supports playbook-based automation by integrating with Microsoft Flow (also known as Power Automate).

Specific Defender for Cloud Apps alerts can be configured as playbook triggers, automating pre-approved responses and minimising security analyst intervention. Playbooks are created in Microsoft Flow and made available to Defender for Cloud Apps via the Cloud App Security connector. The use of playbooks requires a Microsoft Flow plan.

Playbooks Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Playbooks | Not configured | Not configured by default however an organisation can determine whether Playbooks will be leveraged to assist in automating pre-approved and consistent responses reducing analyst intervention. Use of Playbooks is subject to licensing.

### Microsoft Defender for Identity

Microsoft Defender for Identity is an Azure-hosted security capability designed to monitor AD traffic and alert on suspicious authentication-related activities. Defender for Identity leverages Machine Learning (ML) to analyse user, device, and resource authentication behaviours to build a baseline, then alert security analysts when an authentication attempt occurs that is not consistent with the baseline. Traffic corresponding to known authentication-based attacked, such as Pass-the-Hash (PtH) and Pass-the-Ticket (PtT), is also recognised by Defender for Identity and specific alerts generated.

The Defender for Identity architecture is composed of a Defender for Identity cloud service with the following components:

- Defender for Identity cloud service – Is hosted on Azure infrastructure and at time of writing Defender for Identity cloud service is deployed in the US, Europe, and Asia data centres.
- Defender for Identity portal – Management interface where the Defender for Identity instance can be created, displays data collected by Defender for Identity sensors and is the central console for monitoring, managing and investigating threats.
- Defender for Identity sensor – Sensors are installed on all domain controllers which monitor and collect domain controller traffic that is fed back to the Defender for Identity portal for analysis.

A high-level illustration of Defender for Identity architecture is shown below in Figure 7. Figure reproduced from [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/defender-for-identity/prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/defender-for-identity/prerequisites)

![Figure 7 - Microsoft Defender for Identity Architecture](../img/platform-defender-for-identity.png#center)

A single Defender for Identity instance can monitor multiple AD DS forests and their respective domains.

Defender for Identity relies on Network Name Resolution (NNR) to correlate between raw activities (containing IP addresses) and the relevant devices involved in the activities to be able to generate security alerts for suspicious activities. To correlate IP addresses to device names, Defender for Identity sensors lookup the IP addresses using these methods:

- NTLM over RPC (TCP Port 135).
- NetBIOS (UDP port 137).
- RDP (TCP port 3389) – only the first packet of Client hello.
- Queries the DNS server using reverse DNS lookup of the IP address (UDP 53).

Microsoft recommends using all the above methods, however if this is not possible the organisation should use the DNS lookup method and at least one of the other methods available at [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/defender-for-identity/nnr-policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/defender-for-identity/nnr-policy).

Defender for Identity Design Decisions for hybrid implementations

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Number of Defender for Identity instances | One | A single Defender for Identity instance can monitor multiple AD DS forests.
Defender for Identity instance name | {organisation-instance-name}.atp.azure.com | The Defender for Identity cloud service will be given an Defender for Identity instance name which will be used to access the Defender for Identity portal.
Forests and domains to be monitored by Defender for Identity | {organisation}.com.au | Nominated organisation forests and domains.
Defender for Identity sensor deployment | To all DC's within the identified forests and domains. | Best practice to ensure all authentication traffic is monitored by Defender for Identity.
Internet connectivity | Domain controllers must have internet connectivity | Domain controllers which will have Defender for Identity sensors installed, must have internet connectivity to the Defender for Identity Cloud Service. <br>Defender for Identity sensors support the use of a web proxy / WPAD for internet connectivity.
Directory service accounts | A standard AD user account & password<br><br>A group Managed Service Account (gMSA) | If the organisation environment consists of Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 domain controllers a standard AD user account and password is required with read access to all objects in the monitored domains.<br><br>If organisation environment consists of Windows Server 2012 or above domain controllers than a group Managed Service Account (gMSA) is required with read access to all objects in the monitored domain.<br><br>If the organisation environment consists of a mixture of domain controller operating system versions, then a combination of group Managed Service Account (gMSA) and Standard user account is required. See [Microsoft Defender for Identity prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/defender-for-identity/prerequisites).
Network Name Resolution (NNR) | Reverse DNS lookup and one other method (listed above) | This is the minimum NNR requirement for Defender for Identity. Microsoft recommends using all of the above-mentioned resolution methods available within organisation environment.
Deleted Objects container permissions | Read-only | Microsoft recommends users should have read-only permissions assigned on the [Deleted objects container](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/defender-for-identity/prerequisites#before-you-start) to allow Defender for Identity to detect user deletions from the Agencies Active Directory.

#### Role groups

Defender for Identity provides security groups to allow the implementation of a RBAC model.

Azure AD provides the basis for the Defender for Identity role groups. When Defender for Identity is enabled for the first time it automatically creates the three security groups in Azure AD, using the product's previous name - Azure ATP. The three Defender for Identity security groups are:

- Azure ATP {Instance Name} Administrators – Provides full administrative access to the specific Defender for Identity instance including all configuration settings.
- Azure ATP {Instance Name} Users – Able to modify configurations relating to suspicious activities (i.e. change status and add exclusions), alerts and scheduled reports, but not the configuration of Defender for Identity sensors or data sources.
- Azure ATP {Instance Name} Viewers – Access to log into the Defender for Identity console to view suspicious activities and download reports. Not able to modify the status of a suspicious activity or add any exclusions.

Note, in addition to the role groups described above, any tenant Global and Security Admins can login to the Defender for Identity portal.

Role group Design Decisions for hybrid implementations.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Members of the Azure ATP Administrators group | Organisation decision | Only specific users that require administrative access should be added to this group.
Members of the Azure ATP Users group | Organisation decision | Include membership of the cyber security team that are responsible for the day-to-day use and management of Defender for Identity.
Members of the Azure ATP Viewers group | Organisation decision | Include membership of the cyber security team to enable auditing of Defender for Identity.

#### Notifications

In addition to creating alerts in the Defender for Identity console whenever a new suspicious activity or health issue is detected, Defender for Identity can also be configured to send email and syslog notifications. This enables security analysts to monitor existing mailboxes and leverage toolsets such as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) product rather than constantly having to login and view the Defender for Identity portal.

Defender for Identity does not require a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server to be configured to send email alerts. However, the syslog configuration of a SIEM is required to send alerts to it. The required settings include:

- Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) / Internet Protocol (IP) address.
- Port that that SIEM is listening on for syslog alerts.
- Transport protocol, either Transport Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) / Secured Syslog.
- Request For Comments (RFC) 3164 or 5424 format.

Notification Design Decisions for hybrid implementations.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Mail notifications | Enabled for both suspicious activities and health alerts | Notify relevant security teams when unwarranted and unauthorised activities occur.
Syslog notifications | Enabled for both suspicious activities and health alerts | If the organisation has an existing SIEM solution enable the SIEM to gather all possible security-related events.

#### Integration with Defender for Endpoint

Defender for Identity supports native integration with Defender for Endpoint.

The purpose of this is to combine Defender for Identity's monitoring of AD and DCs specifically, with Defender for Endpoint's monitoring of general endpoints, to provide a single interface that combines events and alerts from both.

Integration with Defender for Endpoint Design Decisions for hybrid implementations.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Integration with Defender for Endpoint | Enabled | To integrate data feeds and alerts from both products.

#### Firewall

As Defender for Identity is reliant upon the Defender for Identity portal and the Defender for Identity sensors, firewall ports are required to be opened to allow communication between infrastructure (Domain Controllers and standalone servers) and Defender for Identity. These port configurations are updated frequently and are available online from Microsoft ([Configure endpoint proxy and Internet connectivity settings for your Microsoft Defender for Identity Sensor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/defender-for-identity/configure-proxy), [Microsoft Defender for Identity prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/defender-for-identity/prerequisites)).

It is important to note the traffic between the client and the Defender for Identity portal offering is TLS1.2 encrypted. Configuration will occur on the proxy, external gateway and local infrastructure servers of the organisation as required.

Firewall rules and proxy allow lists will be implemented as part of the Defender for Identity solution.

- Defender for Identity service location – As mentioned previously, Defender for Identity data centres are deployed in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The organisation's Defender for Identity instance will be created in the data centre that is geographically closest to the organisation's Azure AD service. This will assist in determining which service location to utilise for generating allow lists. For Azure AD tenants located in Australia, Defender for Identity will be created in Asia.
- Maximal security and data privacy – Defender for Identity cloud services use certificate based mutual authentication for communication between Defender for Identity cloud backend and all Defender for Identity sensors. To make the authentication process seamless as possible if the organisation's environment utilises SSL inspection then the inspection should be configured for mutual authentication.

Further details on the firewall configuration for the solution can be found in the [Hybrid - Network Configuration ABAC](../../as-built-as-configured/hybrid-network-configuration).

#### Integration with Defender for Cloud Apps

Defender for Cloud Apps is a Cloud Access Security Broker that provide visibility, control over data travel and powerful analytics to identify and deal with cyberthreats. Integrating Defender for Identity with Defender for Cloud Apps extends this capability to hybrid environments and presents all Defender for Identity Suspicious Activity (SA) alerts to the Defender for Cloud Apps dashboard, reducing the need for security analysts to monitor multiple consoles.

To connect Defender for Identity to Defender for Cloud Apps the administrator enabling the setting must be an Azure AD Global Admin. Integration is enabled in the Defender for Cloud Apps console and does not require configuration from the Defender for Identity console. Defender for Cloud Apps allows Agencies to access the Defender for Identity data within a single monitoring and management portal reducing the number of monitoring consoles required, however the following needs to be considered:

- Alerts – Defender for Cloud Apps can display Defender for Identity alerts within the Alerts queue. Defender for Cloud Apps also provides additional alert filtering not available within Defender for Identity.
- Alerts management – Management of alerts can be performed in both Defender for Cloud Apps and Defender for Identity portals. Closing alerts in one portal will not necessarily close the same alert in the other portal. It is recommended to choose which portal will be used to manage and remediate alerts to avoid duplicate effort.
- SIEM notification – both Defender for Identity and Defender for Cloud Apps can be configured to send alert notification to a SIEM. In the event this is configured duplicate SIEM notifications for the same alerts will be visible within SIEM under different alert ID's. To avoid this situation, it is recommended to choose which portal will be used to perform alert management and then only this portal is to be configured to send alert notification to a SIEM.
- Activities – Defender for Cloud Apps displays Defender for Identity alerts also in the activity log. Defender for Cloud Apps provides additional activity filtering not available within Defender for Identity.

Integration with Defender for Cloud Apps Design Decisions for hybrid implementations

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Integration with Defender for Cloud Apps | Enabled | To integrate data feeds and alerts from both products.

### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (formally Defender Advanced Threat Protection) extends the standard Microsoft Defender capabilities to provide additional reporting, pre-breach protection, post-breach detection, automation, and response. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint does not require an agent on the endpoint or any on-premises infrastructure, instead it leverages Microsoft's cloud platform. A single dashboard allows administrators to monitor the compliance and security of all Defender-enabled devices, as well as providing ISO27001 certified Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) functionality.

Defender for Endpoint also provides the following capabilities:

- Threat and vulnerability management - discovery of vulnerabilities resulting from missing patches and misconfigurations.
- Attack surface reduction - enforcement of exploit mitigation techniques.
- Network protection - expanding on SmartScreen to block HTTP(S) with low reputation scores.
- Web protection - including web threat protection and content filtering using web categories.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can be configured with the following options:

- Data Retention Period - Data Retention Period defines how long gathered telemetry data is stored and available for use in online reporting.
- Alert Notifications - Alert Notifications are configurable rulesets that allow a person or group of people to receive a notification on the occurrence of a pre-set event.
- Secure Score Baseline - Secure Score Baseline configures the product baselines for calculating the score of Microsoft Defender security controls on the secure score dashboard. If third-party solutions are in use the corresponding controls should be excluded from the calculations.
- Administration Roles and Machine Groups - Administration roles provide the ability to configure role-based access and granular options for regulating permissions to portal features and data. Machine groups enabled machines to be organised into groups and apply configured automated remediation levels and assigned administrators.

### Log Analytics

Log Analytics is a component of the Azure Monitor solution and also forms the storage location for the data analysed by Microsoft Sentinel. It is utilised for log ingestion and querying. Logs can be ingested into Log Analytics in several ways including via:

- Diagnostic Settings
- Sentinel Connectors
- HTTP Post.

Log data stored in Log Analytics data can be consumed in various ways:

- Azure Portal -- Azure Portal allows you to create Log queries and analyse the results.
- Azure Monitor Alert rules -- An alert rule is a search that is automatically run at regular intervals. The results are inspected to determine if an alert in Azure Monitor should be generated.
- Azure Dashboards -- Dashboards can be used per Azure user to visualise data gathered from Log Analytics, these dashboards can be shared amongst Azure administrators.
- Export -- Data from Azure Monitor can be imported into Excel or Power BI for further visualisation.
- PowerShell -- PowerShell from a command line or using Azure Automation, can programmatically retrieve data for various use-cases.
- Azure Monitor Logs API -- The native API, uses REST to retrieve log data from the workspace.
- Microsoft Sentinel -- Microsoft Sentinel allows dashboarding, alerting, and analysis of the logs.

Log Analytics is billed per gigabyte (GB) of data ingested and retained into the service. When ingesting into a SIEM, data retention periods can be shortened.

### Security Information and Event Management

SIEM is a combination of tools and services that provide insights into a network. The tools and services are classed as either Security Information Management (SIM) or Security Event Management (SEM). SIEM tools gather log files from devices for analysis and reporting. Through this process security threats and events can be identified. SIEM tools provide real-time analysis of log and event data to alert administrators to potential issues like security threats. When combined into a SIEM the organisation is provided with:

- Real-time visibility for the organisation's systems.
- Centralised event log management meaning data is consolidated from multiple sources across the network.
- Correlation of events gathered from different logs and security sources.
- Automated security event notification for administrators.

In a hybrid environment the SIEM can be located either on-premises or in the cloud. In either location, all logs from the environment should be sent to one SIEM. This ensures maximum insight and creates a single pane of glass. To ensure that all logs from the cloud can be ingested by the SIEM compatibility of the SIEM product with Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Azure, and Azure Monitor should be investigated.

### Azure AD tenant restrictions

Office 365 and other enterprise SaaS applications that use Azure AD as their identity provider all share URLs with common domain names like `outlook.office.com` and `login.microsoftonline.com`. Blocking these internet addresses to prevent users from accessing other third-party Office 365 tenancies and services would also prevent users from accessing the organisation's own Office 365 tenancy. With Azure AD tenant restrictions, agencies with a supported web filtering (proxy) system can specify the list of approved Azure AD tenants that their users are permitted to access (e.g. GovTeams). Azure AD then only grants access to these permitted tenants.

Azure AD tenant restrictions prerequisites are as follows:

- The organisation's web filtering service supports TLS interception, HTTP header insertion, URL and FQDN filtering.
- Endpoints must trust the web filtering services PKI certificate chain for TLS communications.  

For more detail on Azure AD tenant restrictions, see [use tenant restrictions to manage access to SaaS apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/tenant-restrictions).

## Client configuration

### Microsoft Endpoint Manager - Intune

Microsoft Endpoint Manager - Intune (Intune) is an Microsoft 365 service that provides Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM) capabilities for Apple iOS, Google Android and Microsoft Windows devices to enhance security and protection.

Intune manages which devices can access corporate data, protects company information by controlling the way data is shared, and enforces device configuration to ensure security requirements are met. It does this via:

- Device Enrolment Profiles – Prior to managing devices in Intune they must be enrolled as either Personal or Corporate devices. These can either be self-enrolled or automatically enrolled.
- Device Compliance Policies – Device Compliance Policies are rules, such as device PIN length or encryption requirements, that can be applied to devices. These rules must be met before a device is considered compliant. Device Compliance can then be used by services such as Conditional Access.
- Device Configuration Profiles - Device Configuration Profiles provide the ability to control settings and features on supported endpoints. These include, device and user settings, browser settings and hardware settings. Device Configuration Profiles can be deployed to specific users or devices in Azure AD groups.
- Device Security Baselines – Security baselines are pre-configured groups of Windows settings that are recommended by Microsoft security teams. The security baselines are templates and are used to create a profile that is specific to the environment for deployment.
- Client Applications – Client applications can be delivered to devices registered in Intune based on device type and group membership. Application types that can be distributed include store apps, MS Office suite, MS Edge browser, web links, line of business and Win32 applications. Monitoring of application distribution is provided.
- Software Updates – Software update policies store the configuration of updates without the updates themselves. This prevents the need to approve individual updates allowing for a faster turnaround time. Individual policies can be created and targeted to different groups of devices.

When devices are enrolled into Intune, authorised administrators are able to view hardware details, how the device is used, and what compliance levels currently are for the device's software, hardware, and operating system.

Additionally, Intune can present a customised Company Portal to end users which can be used to install and launch applications or websites via single sign-on (SSO) authentication.

Intune is a component of EMS and integrates with other EMS components such as Azure AD and Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) natively. This allows for total granular visibility of all endpoints within the Enterprise Mobility Management sphere and simplifies the approach for management.

To complement this visibility, an Intune Data Warehouse can be deployed to capture and create custom reports from Intune data using a reporting service. This can assist in gaining insight into which users are using Intune, what licences are being used, operating system and device breakdowns, and compliance trends. The Data Warehouse also has the capability to export directly to Power BI and create interactive & dynamic reports.

Intune can also configure Windows Information Protection (WIP) policies. WIP can be deployed to:

- Protect against potential data leakage – WIP protects against potential data leakage without any impact to user functionality.
- Protect enterprise applications and data - WIP protects against accidental data leakage on enterprise-owned and personal devices. This can occur without changes to the corporate environment or applications.

Within WIP, Network boundaries are created as a network perimeter that controls what applications can be accessed on the network.

Clients managed by Intune are configured to refresh their status on an 8-hour interval. During this refresh. their policy compliance, configuration profile, and app assignments are checked. If the client is recently enrolled then the compliance, non-compliance, and configuration check-in runs more frequently.

### Intune - Mobile application management

Mobile Application Management (MAM) allows the management and protection of an organisation's data within an application. It controls data flows into and out of the application container which houses corporate data.

Using MAM, a corporate app that contains sensitive data can be managed on a wide variety of devices. Many productivity apps, such as the Microsoft Office apps, can be managed by Intune MAM. MAM can protect data within the application container using authentication methods and copy/paste controls, but these controls must be balanced with any MDM controls of the device to maintain usability of the solution.

When deploying a hybrid solution, the management of Windows devices should be considered when choosing to implement MAM for clients. Management solutions such as Group Policy and MECM can provide functionality to control applications which negates the use of MAM on Windows machines.

### Intune - Enrolment

Device enrolment registers the Windows 10 and iOS devices into the corporate device management solution and ensures the device is then able to be managed by administrators.

Microsoft Intune provides a mechanism for enrolling devices into Azure AD. Once registered the device is populated into Intune policy groups using dynamic membership. This ensures that the device meets the compliance policy, monitored, and secured to the organisation's security requirements. 

Microsoft Intune provides three separate experience in enrolling the iOS devices into the organisation's Azure Active directory. The enrolment experiences are:

- Device Enrolment Program (DEP) – Device Enrolment Program is a managed device enrolment process. The devices serial number is registered with Apple Business Manager allows Intune to bypass Assisted Setup by preconfigure device settings. The user's account will be assigned to the device. The device will be marked as a Supervised device.
- Device Enrolment Manager (DEM) – Device Enrolment Manager assigns a single Azure Active Directory account as the owner of the device. The end users cannot administer or purchase any apps on the device.
- User Enrolment – User enrolment process requires users set up the iOS device and manually install Company Portal to register the device as Intune enrolled device. The device will be marked as a BYOD device.

Intune Enrolment Design Decisions for cloud native implementations.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Windows Enrolment | Configured | Windows 10 devices must be enrolled in Intune prior to management of the device.
iOS Enrolment | Configured | iOS devices must be enrolled in Intune prior to management of the device.

### Intune - Co-management

Co-management provides the ability to manage devices via MECM and Intune. 

For a deployment to be enabled for co-management, devices must be Azure AD joined, be enrolled in Intune and have the MECM client installed.

Once co-management is enabled, management tasks such as compliance policies, Windows Update policies, resource access policies, and endpoint protection, can be moved from MECM management over to Intune as required.

Microsoft cloud-hosted services offer the benefit of maintaining cadence with the latest technology updates from Microsoft with reduced effort required by IT BAU teams. Microsoft Intune and Microsoft's co-management strategy is constantly evolving with additional services published regularly.

Intune deploys and manages first-party Microsoft applications in a simple manner but does not allow for a large amount of customisation of update schedule, granular application deployment or application add-ons. Intune does not provide the ability to deploy and update third-party applications in a simple manner at time of writing.

Intune also provides a patching mechanism which simplifies the deployment of Microsoft first-party updates for applications and Windows 10 but does not allow granular control over patches.

The following figure provides an overview of co-management. Figure reproduced from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/comanage/overview

### Intune - Windows AutoPilot

Windows Autopilot provides the ability to set up and pre-configure new devices without the need for on premises infrastructure. It is also possible to use Windows Autopilot to reset, repurpose and recover devices.

Windows Autopilot provides the ability to:

- Automatically join devices – Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
- Auto-enrol devices – Auto-enrol MDM services, such as Microsoft Intune.
- Restrict the Administrator – Restrict administrator account creation.
- Create and auto-assign devices – Auto assign to configuration groups based on a device's profile.

Create and auto-assign devices | Configured | For ease of management and enrolment for devices within organisation.
Deployment profile | Refer to DTA – Intune Enrolment -ABAC document | Deployment profile will ensure that all workstations are configured in accordance with the organisation standards with no user intervention.

### Intune - Device compliance

Device Compliance Policies are rules, such as device PIN length or encryption requirements, that are applied to devices. These policies must be met before a device is considered compliant, the device compliance status can then be used by services such as Conditional Access to grant or disallow access to applications or services.

Microsoft Intune can control access to resources by interrogating endpoints and determining whether they meet a minimum list of features and are judged as "compliant". Compliance can be assigned a grace period where a device which is not judged as compliant can still access resources for a period or be blocked immediately.

Each compliance policy can be edited to ensure that devices are tested before being allowed access to corporate resources.

Device Compliance Profiles deployed ensure a strong security posture for the entire Windows 10 and iOS fleet. Compliance Policies allow the organisation to ensure that baselines are met prior to access being granted to any corporate applications or data. The Windows 10 compliance policy settings include:

- Device Health – This includes BitLocker status and whether code integrity is enabled.
- Device Properties – Including a minimum and maximum Operating System version.
- Configuration Manager Compliance – Whether the endpoint is compliance will all Configuration Manager evaluations. This is especially applicable in a co-managed scenario such as this deployment.
- System Security – Password compliance, standards, length, and complexity. This also includes device level firewall, TPM, Antivirus, Antispyware, and Microsoft Defender Antimalware settings.
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint – Configures the maximum allowed machine risk score, if exceeded the device is marked as noncompliant.

Device Compliance Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Compliance Assessment | Configured | Since mobile devices routinely leave the office environment, and the protection it affords, it is important that organisations develop a mobile device usage policy governing their use.

### Intune - Device configuration

Device Configuration Profiles provide the ability to control settings and features on supported endpoints. These include, device and user settings, browser settings, and hardware settings. Device Configuration Profiles can be deployed to specific users or devices by using Azure AD groups.

There are many supported platforms, each of which have several profile sub-types that they offer configuration for, at the time of writing, the following platforms are supported:

- Android device administrator
- Android Enterprise
- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS
- Windows Phone 8.1
- Windows 8.1 and later
- Windows 10 and later

Within each platform there are number of profile types allowing many settings to be configured. The profile types and settings that are configurable vary depending on the platform.

In general terms, configuration profiles either configure the device for use by the user or secure the device.

Custom profiles can be created for a platform although this should be considered a last resort if the settings are not available in any other way.

In a co-managed state, these settings may be superfluous to existing Group Policies and SOE settings.

### Intune - Information protection

Application protection policies are rules that ensure an organisation's data remains safe or contained in a managed application.

An application protection policy can be a rule that is enforced when the user attempts to access or move "corporate" data, or a set of actions that are prohibited or monitored when the user is inside the app.

Network Boundary – Network Domain | Production domain will be protected. Detailed settings are in the DTA – Platform – ABAC document. | If additional network subnets are identified these can also be added to the Network Domain scope.

### Intune - Software updates

Windows Update for Business uses Intune to manage the installation of updates and features from Microsoft Windows Update servers. There is no requirement for on-premises servers or storage of update files.

Intune stores the update policy assignments not the updates themselves. No requirement for on-premises infrastructure.

There is no requirement or ability to selectively enable or disable a particular update.

Fast and slow update rings can be configured and assigned to different groups or users or devices allow early adopters to provide a level of validation before all users are provided with updates.

When deploying a hybrid solution, the software and patch updates of Windows devices should be considered. Other management solutions such as MECM and Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) may be servicing the Windows devices for the updates hence duplicating processes.

### Intune - iOS

iOS devices will be enrolled with the Intune organisation Portal to gain secure access to organisation data.

After devices are enrolled, they become managed. Agencies can assign policies and apps to the device through a mobile device management (MDM) provider, such as Intune.

Intune iOS Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

### Registry settings

Registry settings are applied to the Windows registry to modify the underlying operating system. Registry settings are typically changed in a client operating system to configure the system or increase the security of system.

There are several tools available to apply registry settings such as:

- Group Policy
- Intune
- Configuration Manager (MECM).

The ACSC provides the Microsoft Windows and Office 365 hardening guides that defines group policy settings along with other recommendations to significantly reduce the attack surface available to malicious attacks.

### Applications

The lifecycle of applications can be managed using Intune. Applications can be deployed, configured, protected and removed.

Managed applications can be provisioned to the following platforms:

- Android
- iOS
- Windows Phone
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 10 and later.

Applications types that can be managed include:

- Store Apps (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Microsoft Store and Google Play)
- The Microsoft Office suite
- Microsoft Edge
- Web links
- Built-In applications
- Line of Business applications
- Win32 applications
- Android Enterprise system applications.

When deploying a hybrid solution, the application lifecycle method should be considered as other management solutions such as MECM may be performing the same service.

Applications Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Application Deployment | Configured | Deployment and monitoring of the deployment can be assigned to users or devices.
Application Configuration | Configured | Store applications are easily updated while Win32 applications will need some packaging.
Application Protection | Configured | In combination with conditional access and network boundaries, applications are limited with respect to the copy, paste, forwarding, printing capabilities.
Application Removal | Configured | When applications (or versions of applications) are no longer required they are removed via organisation's nominated management solution.

### Printing

Printing is a legitimate method of data transfer out of an environment. Printing allows users to physically export data from a network and hence also it can be leveraged by malicious actors for data exfiltration. To minimize the risks associated with printing, the location where printing is allowed should be controlled.

Intune can be leveraged to control what printers are available within a device and whether a user is able to add additional local printers.

For a user to leverage an available printer, connectivity and a device driver is often required. The drivers can be delivered and updated using Intune and/or MECM. Connectivity depends on the connected network(s) of the client. The options include:

- Corporate Network printing – In the workplace, the domain joined computers can connect to the print servers and send jobs to the queue.
- External Network printing via Hybrid Cloud Print – Without network connectivity via Citrix, a VPN, or Microsoft Hybrid Cloud Print, direct print server connectivity is not available. Microsoft Hybrid Cloud Print utilises a reverse proxy to communicate with the print servers located within the work network.
- External Network printing via VPN – When direct printer connectivity is not available from external networks, a VPN such as Windows 10 Always-On VPN can allow clients to function as if they were part of the corporate network.

When deploying a hybrid solution, the allocation of printers to users should be considered. Other management solutions such as Group Policy and MECM may be servicing the allocation of printers to devices.

## Backup and operational management

### RPO, RTO and retention periods

As with an on-premises environment, backups play an important part of an overall cloud solution capability. It is important that critical information is backed up to enable recovery for scenarios such as accidental deletion or corruption.

To ensure a successful backup, configuration of the following items should be taken into consideration:

- What to backup - understanding what configuration, files and mailboxes that need to be backed up is important. If only a partial configuration is backed up, successful restoration may not be possible.
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - RPO defines an acceptable loss of data (in time) for a data type in a data-loss event. RPOs are expressed in hours / days and directly influence the backup approach used, and how backups are performed with sufficient frequency to meet the defined RPO. For example, if an RPO of 12 hours was defined for a given data type, backups of this data type could not be scheduled further than 12 hours apart.
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO) - RTO is used to define the acceptable level of service interruption (in time) between a data loss event and the recovery of the data to a point at which normal service is resumed. When determining RTOs for a given data type, consideration must also be given to any additional recovery process that are undertaken after the restoration of data. The RTO directly influences the type of backups performed and may dictate additional protection mechanisms outside of the backup platform for data types where a very short RTO is defined.
- Legislative Requirements – The Essential 8 details that backups of important information, software and configuration settings are performed. More detail on these controls are listed in the [Protective Security Policy Framework](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-11/pspf-infosec-10-safeguarding-information-cyber-threats.pdf) and the [Essential Eight Maturity Model](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/essential-eight-maturity-model).

It is important that prior to defining the backup and restore policies, RTO and RPO objectives for each data type hosted the environment are defined in line with business requirements and Service Level Agreements (SLA).

There are several enterprise Backup software solutions which can backup data on-premises or in the cloud. Depending on the requirements, a backup solution can cover the following scenarios:

- Backup local data directly to on-premises infrastructure from on-premises.
- Backup local data to on-premises infrastructure and to the Azure storage blob from on-premises.
- Backup cloud data directly from the cloud.

Using the native Office 365 tools only, in combination with recycle bins the following data recovery options and retention periods are available:

- What to backup - understanding what configuration, files and mailboxes that need to be backed up is important. If only a partial configuration is backed up, successful restoration may not be possible.
- Documents, Desktops and Pictures for each user is redirected from the Windows client device to OneDrive using Windows Known Folders providing a backup of data to the cloud.
- OneDrive includes recycle bins allowing recovery of data for up to 93 days.
- SharePoint Online data includes recycle bins allowing recovery of data for up to 93 days.
- Teams chat, channel and files data retained indefinitely by default unless retention policies have been implemented.
- Exchange Online has a recover deleted items from server option allowing recovery of data for up to 30 days.

Retention policies are created that ensure that data is retained forever for:

- Exchange
- SharePoint
- OneDrive
- Microsoft 365 groups
- Skype for Business
- Exchange Public Folders
- Teams channel messages
- Teams chats.

Workstation configuration is stored in Intune (Autopilot rebuild).

Agencies should review the native Microsoft 365 capabilities and determine if they meet their data preservation requirements, or if a third-party backup solution is required.

### Data availability

Microsoft Azure services are available globally and provides geographical, regional, data centre, virtual infrastructure, and application resiliency. This allows the Microsoft Azure platform and Microsoft 365 to combat and minimise potential disasters such as customers loss of connectivity to data or loss of data.

Data availability is an important part of making sure that end users have access to the data when they require it. The cloud-based service of Microsoft 365 will replicate and store organisation's data in multiple data centres which are geographically dispersed  (see [Exchange Online data resiliency in Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/compliance/assurance/assurance-exchange-data-resiliency) and [Data resiliency in Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/compliance/assurance/assurance-data-resiliency-overview)). 

The data availability and resiliency of Microsoft 365 cloud service is in-built and managed by Microsoft.

Data Availability | Configured | Microsoft have in-built data availability into the Microsoft 365 cloud services.

## System administration

System Administration is the process of managing, troubleshooting, and maintaining the solution. To complete this, system administrators are granted permissions over the solution. The allocation of permissions to administrators should align with the administrator's role within the organisation and the principle of least privileged access. The allocation of permission to the administrator's role is captured within the RBAC policy.

### Administrative consoles

To manage and configure the solution, administrators will use various administrative consoles. These consoles are a mixture of server based and web-based consoles that exist internally or in the cloud.

Web based administrative consoles are provided by Microsoft however the URLs for these consoles constantly change (refer to [Microsoft Security Portals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/mtp/portals?view=o365-worldwide)). The consoles listed below are correct at the time of writing.

### Role-Based Access Control

RBAC defines what an end user or administrator can do. In relation to system administration, RBAC provides various roles each of which can only perform certain tasks. For example, help desk staff may be able to only view certain resources, whereas system administrators could view, create, and delete those resources.

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) can be leveraged to enhance the RBAC model available in Azure AD. PIM is an implementation of Just-in-time (JIT) access. JIT access ensures that an administrative account only has privileges when required to complete a function. JIT aligns to the principal of Zero Standing Privilege. Group assignment of Azure AD roles is also supported with PIM.

Each PIM role assignment can have the following attributes:

- Activation Duration - the Activation Duration attribute specifies the duration to allow the access request, the maximum is 72 hours.
- Approver - the Approver attribute specifies the person or people who can approve role activation requests.
- Notification - the Notification attribute specifies that a pending request is awaiting approval via email.
- Incident Request Ticket - the Incident Request Ticket attribute specifies that the approver add an incident ticket number to the approval request.
- Multi-factor Authentication - the Multi-factor Authentication attribute specifies whether MFA is required for activation.

Azure AD roles can be assigned via PIM to various scope types, depending on the specific role being assigned. The scope types include:

- Directory - Roles that apply permissions across the entire Azure AD tenant.
- Administrative unit - Configurable by administrators to segregate permissions within organisation into specific business units or locations.  Note only [specific Azure AD roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/roles/admin-units-assign-roles#roles-that-can-be-assigned-with-administrative-unit-scope) can be assigned with administrative unit scope.
- Application - A specific application registered to Azure AD. These are listed under [App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) in the Azure portal.
- Service principal - Including registered applications, managed identities and legacy apps.

Note: the product name for Microsoft Information Protection is still referred to as Azure Information Protection within the defined Azure AD Roles.

RBAC Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification
--- | --- | ---
Azure AD Role Based Management | Least Privilege, using PIM | PIM will be utilised to provide Just-in-Time role-based management to ensure elevated access is only provided when required.
PIM Roles | Authentication Administrator<br>Azure Information Protection Administrator<br>Global Administrator<br>Exchange Administrator<br>Helpdesk Administrator<br>Intune Administrator<br>Office Apps Administrator<br>Power BI Administrator<br>Power Platform Administrator<br>Privileged Role Administrator<br>Security Administrator<br>Security Operator<br>SharePoint Administrator<br>Teams Communications Administrator<br>Teams Communications Support Engineer<br>Teams Communications Support Specialist<br>Teams Administrator<br>User Account Administrator | The configured PIM roles align to the services utilised within the solution.
PIM approval | Automatic approval for all roles except for Global Administrator | Approval will only be required for Global Administrators.
PIM assignment type | Eligible (for supported roles) | Roles should be assigned as "eligible" for supported roles as per the ACSC Essential Eight guidance for restricting administrative privilege (just-in-time administration). Note, some roles such as SharePoint Administrators and Device Administrators [can experience some delays in applying using PIM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-roles#what-about-microsoft-365-admin-roles). 
PIM assignment period | 12 Months | Assignment of all roles within PIM for a maximum of 12 months as per the ACSC Essential Eight guidance for restricting administrative privilege. 
Activation duration | 8 hours | The activation duration will be one workday to ensure that administrative actions are not impeded.
