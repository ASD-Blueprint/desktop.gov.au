# Welcome

The blueprint is a straightforward and secure way to deploy Microsoft 365 and Azure. Security should make your environment easy and convenient to use, not the opposite. We believe that your modern desktop should be fast, secure, reliable and, overall, a pleasure to use.Â 

The blueprint provides guidance on all Microsoft 365 features. New, old and yet to come. We test and deploy new features and publish our findings for everyone to use. Better security should be available for all of us.

We've taken the great work started by the Digital Transformation Agency, and us, then we've added, updated and expanded on it to provide everyone with a simple way to consume cloud services without the risk.

Have a look around, and if you have a suggestion, feel free to drop us a line in [GitHub](https://github.com/oobecomau/theblueprint).

Check out some of our products below that we use ourselves to assist with Microsoft 365 deployments, and if you need a hand with implementing the blueprint, get in touch.
