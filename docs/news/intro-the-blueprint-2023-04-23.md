# Introducing the blueprint

23 April 2023

Many of you will be familiar with desktop.gov.au, and the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) PROTECTED Utility Blueprint. You may know it better as the DTA Blueprint, which still lives at desktop.gov.au.

It was a great initiative when it was launched. You may not know that oobe helped write it, the DTA published, and oobe deployed it as a pattern in many, many environments. But we at oobe noticed that it hadnâ€™t been updated for a while and the content was getting a little long in the tooth. Last meaningful updates were in July 2022. So we thought, why not keep the dream alive and move a bit faster to keep the content fresh? Itâ€™s such a great initiative that we couldnâ€™t let it ride off into the sunset. Enter:

The blueprint powered by oobe. Still open source, still publicly available, forked from the DTA Blueprint on GitHub but with more oobe green and some additions and recommendations for how we at oobe deploy things â€“ securely, but still nice to use.

Oh, and if you need a hand with a deployment, youâ€™d like to make a suggestion or youâ€™d just like to say hi, feel free to drop us a line on GitHub or contact us via the link on the homepage ðŸ˜Š.

The blueprint is something we're proud of, and weâ€™re excited about where is now and whatâ€™s coming next. Donâ€™t touch that dial.
