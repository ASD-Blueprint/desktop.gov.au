# Windows 11

23 April 2023

At oobe we’ve been running Windows 11 for a while in our fleet and we’re excited at where it’s headed. For the first time in a long time the day 1 release has been worth it as it’s faster, looks nicer and has some more intuitive features. But how do you secure it?

The [**ACSC**](https://www.cyber.gov.au) has published advice for Windows 10 up to 21H1, but Windows 11 or more recent releases of Windows 10 do not currently appear on their website. So we reached out to the ACSC's Government Uplift team for advice. Their response was that the controls in the Windows 10 hardening guide also apply to Windows 11, and therefore should continue to be used.

We'll continue to keep an eye out for any updates from the ACSC, or guidance from our international partners, and update the blueprint accordingly. In the meantime, we’ve added some guidance that we’ll be maintaining, like everything in the blueprint, specifically on securely deploying Windows 11. It builds upon our real-world experience and our pedigree managing Windows for many, many years.

You’ll find the updated guidance in the Client Devices section, with updates to the configuration guides to follow soon.
