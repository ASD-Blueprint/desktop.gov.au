## Implementation options 

There are two ways to implement Protected Utility. 

### Do it with you 

We will provide you with the Blueprint and, based on your cloud readiness assessment, help you make the transition. This may include help with funding for the transition, technical support, and technical resources. 

### Do it yourself  

We will provide you with the Blueprint and access to a cloud readiness assessment.
