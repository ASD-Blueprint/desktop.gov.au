  ## Community
  We created the Protected Utility community so the DTA can work with other agencies and industry partners who are implementing the Blueprint. It's a place to work together to overcome common technical obstacles, share lessons learnt and provide feedback to enhance the overall Blueprint design. We also bring you expert advice about implementing the Blueprint, security and cloud adoption.

## Protected Utility Program

Welcome to the website for the Protected Utility Program. The Program standardises how Government agencies operate their desktops, improves collaboration within and across agencies, and helps achieve a cyber security uplift across government.

The Program helps agencies transition to cloud-based capability and adopt the Blueprint.  

This website helps you understand why your agency should adopt the Blueprint, how you can implement the Blueprint and how we can help you. 

We also encourage you to join our [online community](https://community.desktop.gov.au/) for the Protected Utility Program.
