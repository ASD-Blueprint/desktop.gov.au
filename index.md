  ## Community
  We created the Protected Utility community so the DTA can work with other agencies and industry partners who are implementing the Blueprint. It's a place to work together to overcome common technical obstacles, share lessons learnt and provide feedback to enhance the overall Blueprint design. We also bring you expert advice about implementing the Blueprint, security and cloud adoption.

## Protected Utility Program

Welcome to the website for the Protected Utility Program. The Protected Utility Program is a taskforce within the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA). 

The purpose of the Program is to standardise how Government agencies operate their desktops, which, in turn, standardises how government agencies communicate and collaborate and ensures a secure environment up to the Protected classification.  

We do this by helping agencies transition to the cloud and adopt the Protected Utility Blueprint, which was released by the Program in March 2020. 

This website helps you understand why your agency should adopt the Blueprint, how you can implement the Blueprint and how we can help you. 

We also encourage you to join our [online community](https://community.desktop.gov.au/) for the Protected Utility Program.
