title: Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
excerpt: BYOD allows users to utilise their own consumer devices and access corporate data and applications securely. Polices can assist with protection of corporate . This pattern provides guidance on how to implement various options within the blueprint but outlines some risks involved on the security posture to PROTECTED while doing this.
---

*Executive level intro - talk about what BYOD is in M365, what it has to offer, benefits and overaching M365 options with some form of diagram, include some considerations regarding PROTECTED, ISM, Essential 8*

*Introduce some limited options (e.g. MAM without enrollment, Virtual Desktop for protected BYO, to scope the document, this will allow a patten to be selected and As-Built guide to be followed.* 

*Explain BYOD company policy would need to be implemented to compliment this.*

## Assumptions

The following represent the assumptions when considering to deploy BYOD options into an existing blueprint deployment.

* Licensing is available for Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Windows 10 Enterprise and FSLogix.
  * Microsoft 365 E3, E5
  * Windows E3, E5
* *More assumptions on the current configuration*

## Prerequisites

The following represent the prerequisites before deploying the selection BYOD option .

* *Prereqs here for all*

Cloud native:

* *Cloud Native only pre-reqs*

Hybrid:

* *Hybrid pre-reqs*

## BYO Options

### Options comparison

*Introduce each pattern option in the blueprint. The options could be combined as bolt ones perhaps....*

Options | Use-Cases | Effort to implement | Security Risk / E8 Maturity Level considerations 
--- | --- | ---| ---
 Option 1   | E.g. what apps , what level of access, what level of enrollment | Easiest             | Residual risk ratings to PROTECTED, etc          
 Option 2   |                                                              | Difficult           | Meet PROTECTED level controls etc. <br />        
 *Option 3* |                                                              |                     |                                                  

*Include a flow chart to determine how to make a decision between Options as a blueprint user....*
