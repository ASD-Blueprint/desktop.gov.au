- title: 1. Engagement
    body: |
    During engagement, the customer agency [reviews the blueprint](/blueprint/), understanding the general overview, benefits, and what it offers them. The customer may register an account on the [Community Portal](www.community.desktop.gov.au). The customer then reaches out to the DTA to understand what the blueprint can offer, and what is required to use it.  
- title: 2. Discovery
  body: |
    During [discovery](discovery.md), the customer and the DTA, guided by a strategy partner vendor, work together to understand the agencyâ€™s business and technical environment, understand its mission and strategy, work to mitigate any adoption risks, and understand drivers and blockers to using M365. The DTA funds Discovery.

The Protected Utility engagement model outlines how customers access [the DTA Protected Utility Program](/faq) and how to maximise the use of [the blueprint](/blueprint) for modern desktop services. 

The Model has five approximate stages. These stages are fluid and may happen concurrently or in cycles:
1. [Engagement](/engagement.md)
2. [Discovery](/discovery.md)
3. [Deploy](/deploy.md)
4. [Transition](/transition.md)
5. [Adoption and Evaluation](/adoption-evaluation.md)
