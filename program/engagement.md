## About

During engagement, the customer reviews the Protected Utility Blueprint and may register an account on the Community Portal. The customer then reaches out to the DTA to understand what the Blueprint can offer, and what is required to use it.  

## Roles

* The DTA Protected Utility Program team.
* The customer agency.

## Tools, templates and guidance

* The [Protected Utility Blueprint] document. 

## Enabling services

* The [community.desktop.gov.au] community portal: for asking questions, FAQ, and understanding which agencies are using the Blueprint. 
* The desktop.gov.au website: for information, the latest version of the Blueprint, and knowledge articles.  
* The protectedutility@dta.gov.au mailbox: for initial enquiries. 

## Benefits

* The customer can access a self-service document to standardise and modernise their ICT, 24/7. 
* The customer receives support in understanding how they use a modern desktop. 
* The customer can connect with other agencies to learn best practice, manage common pitfalls, and ask questions. 

## Risks if ignored

* The value of using the Blueprint may not be maximised.
* Skills, best practice and lessons learnt might not feed back into future updates to the Blueprint. 
* Agencies might implement their own technology and business change without the community or Program's support, thus leading to individual and more expensive procurements. 

## What success looks like

* The DTA and the customer agency have established a path forward for how the customer might use the Blueprint. There is an understanding of the customer's business need and high-level ICT and business strategy. There is a signed letter of intent outlining what the DTA will provide for the customer.
