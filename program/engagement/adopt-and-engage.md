title: Phase 4 Adopt and Engage
timeline: 
- title: Step 1 – Prepare your strategic communications
  body: | 
    A communications strategy, key messaging and a communications plan will set you up for success in engaging your audiences about the new ways of working. Your business transformation narrative will inform your communications strategy and key messaging in order to reach your key audience groups. Your communications strategy will then inform your communications plan, including mapped user journeys, communications activities and key touch points to engage your key audiences.
- title: Step 2 – Adopt the business change and support your staff with training
  body: | 
    Training will ensure staff are supported and have the capabilities they need to adopt the new ways of working. Timely training will support staff to use the Modern Workplace services for the first time by upskilling via e-Learning, face-to-face training and peer training.
- title: Step 3 – Assess your agency’s business readiness
  body: | 
    With the help of a strategy partner you can assess your business readiness and the business change impacts associated with adopting a Modern Workplace. A business readiness assessment will help you to understand which divisions within your agency are ready to adopt the new ways of working. The assessment may include skills, culture, willingness to adopt the business change, leadership and staff support, and other drivers and risks to a successful adoption.  
- title: Step 4 – Engage your staff with communications and realise benefits iteratively
  body: | 
    With the adoption of the blueprint and the iterative realisation of benefits associated with the Modern Workplace, it’s important to engage staff with cut-through communications. A carefully crafted communications plan will inform timely communications activities that will engage staff with the new ways of working and share the early benefits your agency is starting to see. You could also review [key messaging](/program/engagement/key-messaging.html) that we have provided which can help you sell the change to various stakeholders in your organisation.
