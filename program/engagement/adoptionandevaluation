- title: Step 1 – Enact continual service improvements 
    body: | 
        The customer puts in place continual service improvements to their modern desktop suite. They may do this through continuing a support agreement with a technology partner, or their own in-house ICT and change capability.  
- title: Step 2 – Knowledge Sharing and Community Participation 
    body: | 
        The customer agency engages with the community. For example, they may complete the ongoing [Protected Utility survey] or another survey, post threads on the [Community Portal], engage in evaluation workshops (also called ‘retros’), and [attend WoG modern desktop training]. 
--- 

The customer agency consumes modern desktop services. Additionally, the customer shares lessons learnt, asks questions of the community, and seeks to understand what worked well and what didn’t. These lessons learnt are harvested through surveys, community discussions, and workshops with the DTA. This improves best practice across WoG. 

## Roles 

* The DTA Protected Utility Program team 
* The customer agency

## Tools, templates and guidance 

* The [Protected Utility blueprint](/blueprint/) document.  
* [Community survey] 
* [Newsletter] 
* [WoG training calendar] 
* [Retro workshop plan] 

## Enabling services 

* The [community portal](https://community.desktop.gov.au/): for asking questions, FAQ, and understanding which agencies are using the blueprint.  
* The [desktop.gov.au](https://desktop.gov.au/) website: for information, the latest version of the blueprint, and knowledge articles.   
* The [protectedutility@dta.gov.au](mailto:protectedutility@dta.gov.au) mailbox: for initial enquiries.  
* Survey platform - Qualtrics 

## Benefits 

* The customer can share and receive lessons learnt, which enables them to maximise the use of the Blueprint, mitigate adoption risks, and continue to improve their service.  
* Greater security from improved Blueprint designs.  
* The customer can connect with other agencies to learn best practice, manage common pitfalls, and ask questions.  

## Risks if ignored 

* The Blueprint design and service may not improve to reflect realtime practice. 
* Customer agencies may individually learn their own lessons, missing opportunities to improve digital capability across WoG.  
* Opportunities to standardise and modernise ICT may become lost in silos.  

## What success looks like 

* The customer agency is an active member of the Protected Utility community (i.e has active members posting discussion topics and attending training). 
* The customer is actively consuming modern desktop services based on the Blueprint. 
* The customer contributes to the Blueprint’s iterative improvements as well as improvements to business processes and M365 in their own organisation.
