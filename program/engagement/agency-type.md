title: Self-assess your agency
--- 

We understand that each agency’s circumstances and starting points are different. As such, we’ve tailored the Protected Utility blueprint engagement framework to help you to identify where you are in your process – that way you can engage with this framework in the most efficient and relevant way by aligning your agency type according to which one you think best describes your agency.

We have created a [shareable PDF version](/assets/files/pdf/dta-pub-technology-maturity-assessment-toolkit.pdf) of this process. 

## Which agency type are you?

There are two factors you need to take into consideration when determining which agency type best reflects your situation: 

1. Complexity of needs
  * Do you have a diverse team requiring distinct ways of working? 
  * Is your team geographically dispersed?
  * Does your team face technology access challenges?
  * Do you have specialist systems to consider?
  * Does your agency have complex business processes?
  * Do you have complex legislative requirements to take into account?
2. Barriers to change
  * Do you have internal resources capable of directing this change initiative?
  * How big of a job will it be to roll out the business transformation? (How big is the shift and how many people need to shift?)

Your placement on this spectrum will help you navigate the engagement framework in a way that’s relevant and meaningful to your agency’s needs. 

To help you to validate which agency you align to, we’ve created the following checklist.

## Lean

* “We barely have the time or budget for the current transformation”
* “We are open to cloud services but are happy with the current service”

You're likely to be a lean agency if:

* Your agency is small in size (<100 staff)
* Your workforce skills, resources and budget for technology adoption and business change are constrained
* Funding, change management and technology capability are barriers
* You are required to procure the services of a change or technology partner to successfully adopt and benefit from the Protected Utility blueprint services.

## Aligned

* “We have budget but not the skills to utilise cloud and mobile office”
* “We jump at the chance to push things out so we can focus on other things”

You're likely to be an aligned agency if:

* You have 500 – 1000 staff
* You are best placed to benefit from using the Protected Utility blueprint services
* You have a desire to adopt cloud-based technology
* You are aware of the complexity and scale of the business change required to fully realise the benefits of the technology
* You require guidance on where to start and how to navigate any challenges related to capability or funding.

## Self-directed

* “We have a complex, special business model”
* “Not convinced that a common platform will meet our needs”

You're likely to be a self-directed agency if:

* You have complex and specific business requirements and mature technical environments
* Cloud services do not always meet the diversity of your needs
* You have some areas / use cases that could benefit from the Protected Utility blueprint services
* The change process to realise the benefits of the blueprint is challenging for your agency.

## Complex

* “It’s not a priority. We have a strategy in place. Our long term objective is not aligned with the DTA”

You're likely to be a complex agency if:

* You have complex and specific business requirements and mature technical environments
* Cloud services do not always meet the diversity of your needs
* You have some areas / use cases that could benefit from the Protected Utility blueprint services
* The change process to realise the benefits of the blueprint is challenging for your agency.
