We understand that each agency’s circumstances and starting points are different. As such, we’ve tailored the Protected Utility blueprint engagement framework to help you to identify where you are in your process – that way you can engage with this framework in the most efficient and relevant way by aligning your agency type according to which one you think best describes your agency.
We have created a [shareable PDF version]() of this process. 

### Which agency type are you?

There are two factors you need to take into consideration when determining which agency type best reflects your situation: 

1. COMPLEXITY OF NEEDS 
 - Do you have a diverse team requiring distinct ways of working? 
 - Is your team geographically dispersed?
 - Does your team face technology access challenges?
 - Do you have specialist systems to consider?
 - Does your agency have complex business processes?
 - Do you have complex legislative requirements to take into account?
2. BARRIERS TO CHANGE
 - Do you have internal resources capable of directing this change initiative?
 - How big of a job will it be to roll out the business transformation? (How big is the shift and how many people need to shift?)

Your placement on this spectrum will help you navigate the engagement framework in a way that’s relevant and meaningful to your agency’s needs. 

To help you to validate which agency you align to, we’ve created the following checklist.

|1. Lean|2. Aligned|3. Self-directed|4. Complex|
|---|---|---|---|
| “We barely have the time or budget for the current transformation”, “We are open to cloud services but are happy with the current service” | “We have budget but not the skills to utilise cloud and mobile office”, “We jump at the chance to push things out so we can focus on other things” | “We have a complex, special business model”, “Not convinced that a common platform will meet our needs” | “It’s not a priority. We have a strategy in place. Our long term objective is not aligned with the DTA” |
