Since its inception in 2019, the Protected Utility Program has supported several agencies to use the blueprint. This page contains some of the case studies.  

## Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)

The DTA supported the AEC by providing funding and procurement leadership for change management activities to fully adopt the blueprint. The DTA enabled the AEC to develop an implementation roadmap and change readiness assessment to enable modern M365 services using the blueprint. 

## The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)

The DTA provided funding and leadership to understand BOMâ€™s business readiness to adopt the blueprint. Specifically, it helped BOM discover its ICT and business change risks, drivers, strategy, and requirements for successfully adopting the blueprint. The information collected helped to inform various change recommendations across governance, change leadership and management, culture, capacity, capability, hardware/software, training, platforms, data management and security. A transition roadmap was then developed, illustrating an indicative sequencing of the recommendations and corresponding actions to successfully transition to the blueprint.
