timeline:
- title: Step 1 - Begin the Connect and Align phase 
  body: |
    Start your blueprint adoption experience by familiarising yourself with all the phases and stages ahead of you. By doing so before jumping ahead, you will be armed with the right information to make this experience clear and efficient – so your agency will realise the maximum value of adopting the new ways of working faster.
- title: Step 2 - Review the engagement framework
  body: |
    Download and read each phase of the [engagement framework](/assets/files/pdf/dta-pub-engagement-framework.pdf) from end-to-end to gain an overview of each phase before taking action.
- title: Step 3 - Review the blueprint
  body: | 
    After reading through the engagement framework phases, you’ll have the context to review the [blueprint](/blueprint/index.html). The blueprint is a complex and technical document that should be reviewed by qualified technical staff. By reading through the detail of this document you will gain an understanding of where and when you may need to involve external partners to help you realise your shift to the Modern Workplace.
- title: Step 4 - Self-identify your agency type
  body: | 
    Understand how best to navigate the engagement framework by [self-identifying](/program/engagement/agency-type.html) your agency type as Lean, Aligned, Self-directed or Complex. Doing so will ensure the information you’re getting has been tailored to support your agency’s unique needs.
- title: Step 5 - Define your initial needs
  body: | 
    Read through some other agencies’ experiences captured in the [User Case Studies](/program/engagement/case-studies.html) to give you an idea of what your agency may need in order to prepare for your change journey. Once you’re clear on what your initial needs may be, the [User Case Studies](/program/engagement/case-studies.html) may also prepare you for any potential blockers or challenges up ahead.
- title: Step 6 - Establish your starting phase
  body: | 
    With a clearer idea of what you need and what challenges to prepare for, you can now plan how you’ll get started with the blueprint adoption.

This is where you start your blueprint adoption experience. The Connect and Align phase is about setting you up with a clear understanding of the path ahead; for how to use the blueprint and how to align it to your business needs. In this phase, we’ll describe what resources are at your side and give you an overview of the steps to come.

The most important part of Connect and Align is the ability to [self-assess your agency](/program/engagement/agency-type.html).

## Benefits

The Connect and Align phase helps you get started and oriented by connecting you with:
