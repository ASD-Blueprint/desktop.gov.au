title: Phase 3 Deploy and Embed 
timeline: 
- title: Step 1 – Begin business consultation for the deployment
  body: | 
    This is where you establish regular and ongoing business consultation for the deployment. By engaging key stakeholders early in the deployment process, you can ensure you have the support and feedback you need for a successful business transformation.  
- title: Step 2 – Setup up your technical environment 
  body: | 
    It’s time to get ready for the deployment. Setup your technical environment to ensure your agency is all set to design and install the required products into your ICT environment.
- title: Step 3 – Implement the blueprint technology
  body: | 
    This is where you implement the blueprint technology to meet your agency’s unique needs and requirements. This can range from a component of the blueprint to a full-scale implementation. You can choose to use an agile approach to roll out the blueprint capability in a series of sprints, and you may benefit from the guidance of a technology partner. 
- title: Step 4 – Configure the appropriate application security controls
  body: | 
    Establish the appropriate application security controls according to the blueprint to enable your agency to securely communicate and collaborate using the new ways of working. 
- title: Step 5 – Undergo testing for the deployment
  body: | 
    It’s important that your agency undergoes testing for the deployment of the blueprint. This will provide you with the assurance you need to confirm that the deployment has worked in your environment.  
- title: Step 6 – Seek relevant architectural and security accreditation for the deployment
  body: | 
    A security assessment will provide relevant architectural and security accreditation for the deployment. This will support you to understand if the Modern Workplace services, applications and data are secure and compliant with the [Information Security Manual](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/ism) (ISM) and other cyber security policies.  
- title: Step 7 – Read key messaging related to where you’re at
  body: | 
    Review [key messaging](/program/engagement/key-messaging.html) that we have provided which can help you sell the change to various stakeholders in your organisation.

This is where the rubber hits the road and we begin the blueprint implementation. The Deploy and Embed phase is designed to support you to adopt a Modern Workplace on the blueprint design, which is available to use in your agency’s ICT environment and plan for business change.

## Benefits

The Deploy and Embed phase helps you to realise the benefits of the blueprint design by: 

* Deploying the Modern Workplace and technology platforms into your ICT environment based on the blueprint design
* Embedding the new ways of working so you have less reliance on legacy systems and don’t lose any of your data
