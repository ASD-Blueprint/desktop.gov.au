timeline: 
- title: Step 1 – Execution Plan 
  body: | 
    The agency will understand what is to be acquired and implemented in their ICT environment.  
- title: Step 2 – Product analysis, build, deploy, and evaluate 
  body: | 
    Throughout Deploy, the agency’s technology partner will begin to deploy modern desktop services. In an agile format, this will mean defining requirements (user stories) in a     sprint, designing a feature set, building and deploying the feature, and evaluating what went well and what requires improvement in the next sprint.  
 - title: Next steps  
  body: | 
    After Deploy, the agency will need to determine its next steps. This may include, for example: 
    * Undergoing change planning in [Transition]().  
    * Acquiring and deploying more relevant technology (i.e undertaking Deploy() again and implementing more features). 
    * Discontinue the process (exit).

timeline:
- title: Step 1 - Review the blueprint
  body: |
    The customer agency [reviews the blueprint](/blueprint/), understanding the general overview, benefits, and what it offers them. 
- title: Step 2 - Request support
  body: |
    The customer agency contacts Protected Utility at [protectedutility@dta.gov.au](mailto:protectedutility@dta.gov.au) with an [initial request email]().
- title: Step 3 - Initial workshop
  body: | 
    The DTA organises an initial workshop with representatives from the customer agency to understand their sponsorship arrangements, high level strategy, business need, budget, and governance. There may be multiple initial workshops.
- title: Decision point - Undertake discovery?
  body: | 
    Based on the initial workshop, the DTA and the customer agency may determine one of the following options:
    
    * Undertake a 4-8 week [discovery phase]() to greater understand strategy, the ICT environment, risks, and processes, and understand the agency's business readiness to use the blueprint. 
    * Undertake a [change management and planning]() phase to transition to using the blueprint from a people, change, and process perspective. 
    * Undertake a [change management and planning]() phase to transition to using the blueprint from a people, change, and process perspective. 
    * Discontinue engagement with the PU and manage their own ICT services under a 'Do It Yourself' 

    The DTA will provide a [Letter of Intent]() to formalise the agreement.

## About 

During deploy, the customer implements Microsoft Office 365. Often, a vendor is required to assist the customer through this process.  A second approach to market may be required to procure technical and organisational change management (OCM) services to accomplish the transition.  

Deploy can happen before or after transition (change management), or could be implemented iteratively, alongside Transition. 

## Roles 

* The DTA
* The customer agency
* Technology partner (optional) 

## Tools, Templates and Guidance 

* User guides 
* User stories 
* Sprint plan 
* Feature log 

## Enabling Services 

* The community.desktop.gov.au community portal: for asking questions, FAQ, and understanding which agencies are using the [Blueprint](/blueprint).  
* The desktop.gov.au website: for information, the latest version of the Blueprint, and knowledge articles. 

## Benefits 

* Agencies can build and start to use modern desktop services and technology platform in their ICT environment. 
* Agencies have a lesser reliance on legacy systems, while not losing any of their data. 

## Risks if ignored 

* Agencies may implement technology in an unplanned fashion. This may delay or reduce the adoption of modern desktop technology.   
* Agencies may invest time and effort into planning for change, but do not implement the modern technology platform. This leads to wasted time, effort, and financial investment, and agencies do not receive the benefit a modern desktop can provide them.    
* Agencies may continue to rely on outdated, bespoke legacy systems.  

## What success looks like  

* Modern desktop services based on the Blueprint design are available to use on the customer’s ICT environment.
