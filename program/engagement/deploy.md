timeline: 
- title: Step 1 – Execution plan
  body: | 
    The agency will understand what is to be acquired and implemented in their ICT environment.  
- title: Step 2 – Product analysis, build, deploy, and evaluate 
  body: | 
    In this step, the customer agency (optionally guided by a technology partner) will design, install, and deploy products onto the ICT environment. This may be done using an agile approach and 'sprints', whereby M365 technology capability is rolled out in a series of sprints.  
- title: Next steps  
  body: | 
    After Deploy, the agency will need to determine its next steps. This may include, for example: 

    * Undergoing business change planning in [Transition](transition.html).  
    * Acquiring and deploying more relevant technology (i.e undertaking Deploy again and implementing more features). 
    * Discontinue the process (exit).

During deploy, the customer implements Microsoft Office 365. Often, a vendor (a technology partner or systems integrator) is required to assist the customer through this process.  A second approach to market may be required to procure technical services to accomplish the deployment.  

Deploy can happen before or after [transition (change management)](transition.html), or could be implemented iteratively, alongside Transition. 

## Roles 

* The DTA
* The customer agency
* Technology partner (optional) 

## Tools, templates and guidance 

* User guides 
* User stories 
* Sprint plan 
* Feature log 

## Enabling services 

* The [community.desktop.gov.au](https://community.desktop.gov.au/) community portal: for asking questions, [FAQ](faq.html), and understanding which agencies are using the [Blueprint](/blueprint).  
* The [desktop.gov.au](https://desktop.gov.au/) website: for information, the latest version of the Blueprint, and knowledge articles. 

## Benefits 

* Agencies can build and start to use modern desktop services and technology platform in their ICT environment. 
* Agencies have a lesser reliance on legacy systems, while not losing any of their data. 

## Risks if ignored 

* Agencies may implement technology in an unplanned fashion. This may delay or reduce the adoption of modern desktop technology.   
* Agencies may invest time and effort into planning for change, but do not implement the modern technology platform. This leads to wasted time, effort, and financial investment, and agencies do not receive the benefit a modern desktop can provide them.    
* Agencies may continue to rely on outdated, bespoke legacy systems.  

## What success looks like  

* Modern desktop services based on the Blueprint design are available to use on the customer’s ICT environment.
