title: Discovery 
timeline: 
- title: Step 1 – Strategy analysis 
  body: | 
    The strategy partner vendor will facilitate workshops to understand the business and ICT environment that the agency operates in. A people, process, and technology (POPIT) analysis will be conducted.  
- title: Step 2 – Understand risks  
  body: | 
    Throughout Discovery, the strategy partner will elect and capture risks and change impacts associated with adopting a modern desktop based on the blueprint. A SWOT analysis may assist this understanding.  
- title: Step 3 – Understand technology maturity 
  body: | 
    The agency’s technology environment and roadmap, including applications, licensing, hardware & peripherals, and technical support will be assessed. This technology environment will be compared to the blueprint design.   
- title: Step 4 – Understand change impacts  
  body: | 
    Based on the risk, technology, and strategy analysis, change impacts will be captured in a change impact assessment.
- title: Step 5 – Security analysis 
  body: | 
    If not already considered in the risk analysis, security requirements and obligations will be assessed against the blueprint and relevant [Protected Security Policy Framework (PSPF)](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/) policies.   
- title: Step 6 – Develop business case 
  body: | 
    A business case for change will be developed. This highlights the recommended path forward in terms of a) technology b) business change. It will also contain relevant high-level options, costs, benefits, disbenefits, assumptions and constraints.  
- title: Next steps  
  body: | 
    After discovery, the agency will need to determine its next steps based on the change impact assessment and associated recommendations. This may include, for example: 
    
    * Undergoing change planning in [Transition](transition.html), by partnering with the DTA in a [Do it with you](faq.html#what-is-the-do-it-with-you-model) model. 
    * Acquiring and deploying relevant technology in [Deploy](deploy.html). 
    * Discontinue the process (exit). 
    * Switching to a [Do It Yourself model](faq.html#what-is-the-do-it-yourself-model) and undertaking their own change management and technology journey to use the blueprint.

During discovery, the customer and the DTA, guided by a strategy partner vendor, work together to understand the agency’s business and technical environment, understand its mission and strategy, work to mitigate any adoption risks, and understand drivers and blockers to using M365. 

The discovery phase is funded by the DTA.  

## Roles 

* The DTA
* The customer agency
* Strategy partner (optional) 

## Tools, templates and guidance 

* Risk assessment or Change impact assessment
* Procurement Plan
* Statement of Work and Section 23
* Business needs or user stories
* Strategy analysis
* Target Operating Model

## Enabling services 

* The [community.desktop.gov.au](https://community.desktop.gov.au/) community portal: for asking questions, FAQ, and understanding which agencies are using the blueprint.  
* The [desktop.gov.au](https://desktop.gov.au/) website: for information, the latest version of the blueprint, and knowledge articles.   

## Benefits 

* Agencies have a greater understanding of their drivers, risks, and blockers for using the Protected Utility blueprint. 
* Agencies can mitigate the risks of business change associated with a modern desktop, and thus improve their chances of successful adoption.   
* Agencies have a greater understanding of the value the Protected Utility blueprint can provide them. 

## Risks if ignored 

* Agencies may not have a clear understanding of the drivers, benefits, costs, and risks of change. This may result in a business change which is not fit for purpose.  
* Agencies may apply the Protected Utility blueprint as a technology solution without understanding the full impact or scope of the business change.  

## What success looks like  

* Having carried out Discovery, agencies have a clear understanding of the change impacts a modern desktop might bring.
