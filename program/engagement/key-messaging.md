title: Key messaging
---

To engage people before, during and after a change to the blueprint is implemented, it is important that you provide clear, simple and timely communication that resonates with your key audience groups. We have created examples of constructive messaging for agency leaders, change champions and staff to support you in communicating changes that may arise from the blueprint implementation and associated business process transformation. The messaging is designed to inspire your communications, so you can enable agency leaders, change champions and staff to feel excited, comfortable, engaged and supported throughout the change.

## How to use

This messaging has been created for technical and non-technical agency staff and service providers to support you in communicating changes associated with the blueprint implementation and business process transformation.
We have provided a communications framework that can be copied, pasted and adapted for your own purposes during the change process. The messaging was created in line with the phases of the Protected Utility blueprint engagement framework.
