title: Transition
timeline: 
- title: Step 1 – Change readiness assessment
  body: | 
    If not already covered in the change impact assessment in Discovery, the agency will undergo a change readiness assessment. This will help understand which divisions  within the agency are ready to adopt the modern desktop. The assessment may include skills, culture, willingness to adopt the change, leadership and staff support, and other drivers and risks to a successful adoption. During change readiness, there will also be a decision point from the DTA to decide how much funding support it can offer agencies during Transition.
- title: Step 2 – Change strategy
  body: | 
    A change strategy will outline the way in which the change to modern desktop will be managed. This is so that the value of the blueprint can be maximised, and risks to successful adoption minimised. The Change Strategy will determine a vision for change, who will be communicated with and when (i.e a Communication Plan, a Skills and Training Needs Assessment or learning strategy, and a clear Benefits register or strategy.
- title: Step 3 – Change plan
  body: | 
    A change plan will outline the concrete steps to be enacted in the short-term. 
- title: Step 4 – Enact the change
  body: | 
    Change will be implemented in this step based on the change plan.
- title: Step 5 – Security assessment
  body: | 
    A security assessment will be conducted to understand if the modern desktop services, applications, and data are secure and compliant with the [Information Security Manual (ISM)](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/ism) and other cyber security policies.
- title: Step 6 - Training and communications
  body: | 
    During this step, staff will be supported in upskilling to use modern desktop services. This may involve e-Learning, face to face training, and peer training. Communications material will also be developed to support the change.
- title: Next steps
  body: | 
    * After Transition, the customer agency must consider its next steps. These may include:  
    * Undergoing further change planning in Transition again. 
    * Undergoing technology build and deployment in [Deploy](deploy.html) 
    * Move to [Adoption](adoption-evaluation.html) and start to realise the benefits of a modern desktop. 
---
During transition, agencies adopt the business change required to work in a modern, secure M365 desktop environment. Benefits are realised iteratively, and the necessary improvements are made to enable this. This includes adapting the business processes to suit the new technology landscape. The customer is independent, empowered, and able to drive its own outcomes. Technology support is provided by the vendor. Lessons learnt and knowledge are shared through a WoG community of practice led by the DTA.   

Transition can happen before or after [Deploy](deploy.html) (product management). The transition phase may also be implemented iteratively, alongside Deploy. 

The DTA may co-fund transition activities with agencies.

## Risks if ignored 

* Business models, processes, practices and culture may not suit the new technology.  
* Agencies may not achieve value for money for the new modern desktop. 
* Agencies may disengage or disempower staff, leading to lower productivity, turnover, or a lack of uptake in using the new modern desktop.  
* Leaders may not fully embrace the value of their staff using a modern desktop.    
* Staff may not develop the skills required to maximise the use of modern desktop. 

## What success looks like  

Leaders and staff support a move to modern desktop and there is a clear vision and rationale for change. Staff are ready and have adequate skills to adopt modern desktop services. Relevant business processes, change, and culture are conducive to using modern desktop services. Risks relating to change have appropriate mitigations.
