## Bio

They started working in Government as part of a grad program, and they scored a permanent position. They have been in the Department ever since and love the perks of being a public servant. They however need a change and are looking to change to a different department / agency / team.

## Understanding the interaction

### Thoughts / opinions / feelings

* I love the work I do, but I want a new challenge
* Having to repeat the same information is quite tedious
* Going through the clearance process and remembering my details is so frustrating
* Having to learn a new system is going to be super tedious

### Pain points

* I need to find my TFN
* Not looking forward to doing an onboarding process again
* I will have to find information again if I need to get another type of security clearance
* The Agency I used to work for had old and slow computers, and I expect the same poor experience

### Want to achieve / get out of interaction

* Seamless transition between teams /  departments / agencies
* Ability to quickly pick up the systems since they are consistent across departments

### Motivation to use MWP?

* Once you learn how to use it, it is the same across any other department, making transition to another role a lot easier

## User journey

Modern workplace benefits:

* Faster device setup
* Interface is more intuitive
* Sees more consistency across Departments

The time it takes IT to provision a new device is reduced by **75%**.

Using Intune and EMS makes it possible to streamline and automate **1,633** device provisioning events per year.
