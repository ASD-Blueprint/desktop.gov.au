The Protected Utility Program helps agencies transition to cloud-based capability and adopt the Blueprint.  

We do this by partnering with agencies to assess their cloud readiness and support their transition to the Blueprint. This can include establishing cloud connectivity, training, security advice and assurance, as well as change management support so agencies can successfully implement a modern workplace.

We also provide agencies with a range of tools and support mechanisms, such as the Protected Utility Program online community, to help them through the process. 

The DTA, in conjunction with Microsoft, also provide training to public servants to increase their cloud skills and capability. 

The aim of the Program is to standardise how Government agencies operate their desktops, which, in turn, standardises how government agencies communicate and collaborate, and helps achieve a cyber security uplift across government.

## Implementation options 

There are two ways to implement Protected Utility. 

### Do it with you 

We will provide you with the Blueprint and, based on your cloud readiness assessment, help you make the transition. This may include help with funding for the transition, technical support, and technical resources. 

### Do it yourself  

We will provide you with the Blueprint and access to a cloud readiness assessment.
