The Protected Utility Program helps agencies transition to cloud-based capability and adopt the blueprint.

We do this by partnering with agencies to assess their cloud readiness and support their transition to the blueprint. This can include establishing cloud connectivity, training, security advice and assurance, as well as change management support, so agencies can successfully implement a modern workplace.

We also provide agencies with a range of tools and support mechanisms, such as the Protected Utility Program online community, to help them through the process.

The DTA, in conjunction with Microsoft, also provide training to public servants to increase their cloud skills and capability.

The Program standardises how Government agencies operate their desktops, improves collaboration within and across agencies, and helps achieve a cyber security uplift across government.

## Modern workplace

The current Protected Utility Program is the commencement of transitioning the APS to a modern workplace.

The modern workplace uses cloud-based solutions to empower teams to be more productive and work together.

The nature of work has changed. Employees expect to work securely from anywhere, on any device, and collaboratively. Organisations need to provide that empowerment, but they also need to protect sensitive information.

The modern workplace enables your workforce to work from anywhere, anytime and brings together best-in-class productivity tools. Productivity no longer relies on the need to be physically present in the office.

To help understand users and their needs, we've developed [6 different personas](personas.html) that represent typical users of the modern workplace.
