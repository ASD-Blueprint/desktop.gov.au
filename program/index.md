The Protected Utility Program helps agencies transition to cloud-based capability and adopt the Blueprint.  

We do this by partnering with agencies to assess their cloud readiness and support their transition to the Blueprint. This can include establishing cloud connectivity, training, security advice and assurance, as well as change management support so agencies can successfully implement a modern workplace.

We also provide agencies with a range of tools and support mechanisms, such as the Protected Utility Program online community, to help them through the process. 

The DTA, in conjunction with Microsoft, also provide training to public servants to increase their cloud skills and capability. 

The Program standardises how Government agencies operate their desktops, improves collaboration within and across agencies, and helps achieve a cyber security uplift across government.
