The purpose of the Program is to standardise how Government agencies operate their desktops, which, in turn, standardises how government agencies communicate and collaborate and ensures a secure environment up to the Protected classification.  

We do this by helping agencies transition to the cloud and adopt the Protected Utility Blueprint, which was released by the Program in March 2020. 

We partner with smaller agencies and assess their cloud readiness, support their transition to Microsoft 365 – which includes establishing cloud connectivity, training, security advice and assurance – and provide change management support so agencies can successfully implement a modern workplace.

We also support larger agencies to adopt the Blueprint. In our [online community](https://community.desktop.gov.au/) for the Protected Utility Program, we provide a range of tools and support mechanisms to help agencies through the process. 

The DTA, in conjunction with Microsoft, also provide training to public servants to increase cloud skills and capability across the Australian Public Service. 

## Implementation options 

There are two ways to implement Protected Utility. 

### Do it with you 

We will provide you with the Blueprint and, based on your cloud readiness assessment, help you make the transition. This may include help with funding for the transition, technical support, and technical resources. 

### Do it yourself  

We will provide you with the Blueprint and access to a cloud readiness assessment.
