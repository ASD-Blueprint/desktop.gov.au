I have worked in both government and private sectors, but realised I wanted the freedom to try new projects and experience new environments. I decided to start doing contract work as it pays better and allows the flexibility needed to start a family.

## Understanding the interaction

### Thoughts, opinions, feelings

* I really enjoy being exposed to numerous projects and agencies
* When my contract end is in sight, I am not relaxed until I have the next job lined up
* Having to go through the IT onboarding process every time I start a new contract is such a waste of my time

### Pain points

* I have to go through a lot of onboarding
* It takes me time to be able to access everything I need due to IT glitches
* I have to carry multiple laptops and electronics
* The agency I used to work for had old and slow computers, and I expect the same poor experience

### Want to achieve / get out of interaction

* Seamless transition between contracts

### Motivation to use modern workplace?

* No longer having to go through the IT onboarding process – being able to use my own personal device will make moving between contracts so much easier

## Modern workplace benefits

* Can swap between accounts using just one laptop
* Consistency in systems
* Does not lose work in the cloud and can securely switch between projects 

Contractors who work on more than one project can use the same device without compromising security.
