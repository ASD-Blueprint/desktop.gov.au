I am rarely in the office as I'm constantly travelling due to the work I do. I look forward to the weekend so I can spend time with family, so I work late to finish admin/paperwork to avoid sacrificing my weekend.

## Understanding the interaction

### Thoughts, opinions, feelings

* I am exhausted – there's not enough hours in the day for me to do everything I need to do
* I am stressed and on the weekend I need to take care of my house and my family, I rarely have time to relax
* I am starting to feel burned out, I can't wait to take a long holiday

### Pain points

* Unreliable internet connection
* I can't get too much work done until I get to my desk
* I end up doing a lot of overtime work
* The agency I work for has old and slow computers, and I have the same poor experience 

### Want to achieve / get out of interaction

* Be able to review documents on the go
* Be able to do admin on the go

### Motivation to use modern workplace?

* Easier to do things on the go, which means less work when they are back at their desk

## Modern workplace benefits

* Reduced meeting time with chat functionality
* Saves up to 4 hours a week from collaboration and information sharing
* Can work on documents on the go 

Teams reduces the total number and duration of meetings. 

Meetings conducted via Teams are more reliable and of very high audio-video quality, resulting in less time spent addressing setup and call-quality issues. 

Information workers save time from collaboration and information sharing, specifically around co-authoring and reviewing documents.
