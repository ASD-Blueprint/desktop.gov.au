I worked in different government departments specialising in my field of knowledge. I have contacts in numerous partner agencies and know that collaborating will be advantageous for all. My child works in the private sector and has shown some of the collaboration tools they use while visiting the grandkids.

## Understanding the interaction

### Thoughts, opinions, feelings

* I want to show taxpayers that we are making the most with their money
* I believe our job is to help the Australian public in one way or another
* I wish people would put their egos aside and work towards a common goal

### Pain points

* Everyone has access to different tools
* Coordinating meetings requires a lot of back and forth
* It is hard to build trust across teams – no one wants to step on each other’s toes

### Want to achieve / get out of interaction

* A better way to collaborate across departments to achieve a common goal
* Less waste of tax payers money

### Motivation to use modern workplace?

* The tools and systems will make it easier for teams to communicate and collaborate, plus it's easier for everyone to get access to the same information

## Modern workplace benefits

* Easier to collaborate within and across agencies
* Built-in restrictions help appropriate use of document classification
* Protected access reduces the risk of password sharing

Employees who work with outside organisations save time by having a shared workspace. Teams can be extended to customers, suppliers, and other outside parties.

Built-in security features enable correct handling of information up to Protected.
